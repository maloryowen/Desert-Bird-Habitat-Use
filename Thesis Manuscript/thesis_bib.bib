We established plots on the north and south facing sides of L. tridentata in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts within four different microhabitats spanning from under the shrub canopy into the open. We counted native and non-native annuals twice during the winter growing season to determine the effects of L. tridentata on the spatial distribution of native and non-native annuals. In both deserts, annual plant abundances were higher on the north side of L. tridentata and in open areas. Native annuals in the Mojave were most abundant near the edge of the shrub canopy, whereas native annuals in the Sonoran were most abundant in open areas. The effects of L. tridentata fertility islands on annual abundances were not consistent between the two deserts we studied. Our study emphasizes the importance of research on native and non-native annuals in multiple regions before generalizations can be made about the effects of L. tridentata on annual plant abundances in desert scrub ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Curve-billed Thrashers and Long-billed Thrashers were studied in Live Oak County, Texas, during the summers of 1977 and 1978. Curve- billed Thrashers nested and foraged mostly within open habitats, although they also nested in dense chaparral if clearings were nearby. Long-billed Thrashers nested and foraged exclusively within dense chaparral. Curve- billed Thrashers often nested in exposed sites whereas Long-billed Thrashers always nested in shelter. Curve-billed Thrashers constructed deeper nests, incubated their eggs for less time each day, and brooded their young for many more days than did Long-billed Thrashers. Curve-billed Thrashers had greater reproductive success (37{\%}) than did Long-billed Thrashers (26{\%}). This difference was attributed to the frequent use of Yucca for nest support by Curve-billed Thrashers. Nest success was not significantly affected by nest height, brood size, or the date when the nest was initiated. Snakes were the primary predators of thrasher eggs and nestlings. The roles of the sexes of Curve-billed Thrashers were examined during the breeding cycle. Females incubated and fed the nestlings significantly more often than males. Only females brooded the young. Male participation varied greatly among pairs and between nesting attempts.},

abstract = {The Turkestan Ground-jay Podoces panderi, a corvid endemic to the deserts of Central Asia, is both understudied and under-protected. Using standardised nest-monitoring protocols and nest cameras, we estimated its breeding productivity for the first time as 0.586 fledglings per nesting attempt (inter-quartile range, IQR 0.413‒0.734), strongly constrained by a diverse set of predator species (accounting for 88{\%} of failures), supporting the broad pattern that a wide spectrum of nest predators operate in arid environments. The probability of nest success for the 35 days from the start of incubation to fledging was low, 0.186 ± 0.06 se (N = 37), with no influence of season date, nest height or nest shrub species. However, pervasive shrub harvest severely limited availability of taller shrubs for nest-site selection, and thus our ability to detect any effect of height on nest survival. Mean clutch size was 4.8 ± 0.8 sd while hatching probability of an egg from a clutch surviving incubation was 0.800 ± 0.050 se and fledging probability was 0.824 ± 0.093 se for individual chicks in successful nests (i.e. that fledged one or more chicks). Two shrub genera, saxaul Haloxylon spp. and Calligonum spp., were used for nesting more frequently than expected ($\chi$152 = 784.02, P {\textless} 0.001), highlighting their importance to breeding habitat suitability. This near-sole reliance on these taller shrub genera, both targeted for illegal cutting, indicates that habitat degradation may lead to increased predation and declines in productivity. Habitat conservation is, therefore, likely to be the most important management strategy for the species and other components of desert systems, as management of so diverse a set of nest predators would be both impractical and inappropriate.},

However, more recent experimental research has uncovered the largely unanticipated, yet striking influence of facilitation (i.e. positive species interactions) on the organization of terrestrial and aquatic communities. Modern ecological concepts and theories were well established a decade before the current renaissance of interest in facilitation began, and thus do not consider the importance of a wide variety of facilitative interactions. It is time to bring ecological theory up to date by including facilitation. This process will not be painless because it will fundamentally change many basic predictions and will challenge some of our most cherished paradigms. But, ultimately, revising ecological theory will lead to a more accurate and inclusive understanding of natural communities.},

abstract = {Understanding how introduced plants reduce food web complexity is critical to effective conservation management within human-dominated systems. In urban breeding birds, the paucity of dietary specialists suggests that a lack of food resources, such as arthropod prey essential for reproduction and survival, may contribute to bird declines. Local plant species composition and abundance is influenced by the landscaping decisions of private homeowners and may be contributing to differences in insect prey availability. In this study, we examined whether non-native plants are a limiting factor to a resident breeding insectivore, the Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). We used caterpillar counts, chickadee foraging observations and detection-corrected hierarchical models, to determine the influence of local landscaping features on insect food availability, chickadee tree preference, site occupancy, site abundance and breeding territory selection. Native plants were more likely to host a higher biomass of caterpillars compared to non-native plants, and chickadees strongly preferred to forage in native plants that supported the most caterpillars. In addition, chickadees were less likely to breed in yards as the dominance of non-native plants increased. Chickadee occupancy increased with tree basal area and chickadee abundance declined as impermeable surface area increased and basal area decreased. Our results demonstrate that non-native plants reduce habitat suitability for chickadees by reducing insect food available for breeding. Improving human-dominated landscapes as wildlife habitat should include increasing native, and arthropod-producing, plant species to effectively support the life history needs of insectivorous birds.},

abstract = {Climate change has caused deserts, already defined by climatic extremes, to warm and dry more rapidly than other ecoregions in the contiguous United States over the last 50 years. Desert birds persist near the edge of their physiological limits, and climate change could cause lethal dehydration and hyperthermia, leading to decline or extirpation of some species. We evaluated how desert birds have responded to climate and habitat change by resurveying historic sites throughout the Mojave Desert that were originally surveyed for avian diversity during the early 20th century by Joseph Grinnell and colleagues. We found strong evidence of an avian community in collapse. Sites lost on average 43{\%} of their species, and occupancy probability declined significantly for 39 of 135 breeding birds. The common raven was the only native species to substantially increase across survey sites. Climate change, particularly decline in precipitation, was the most important driver of site-level persistence, while habitat change had a secondary influence. Habitat preference and diet were the two most important species traits associated with occupancy change. The presence of surface water reduced the loss of site-level richness, creating refugia. The collapse of the avian community over the past century may indicate a larger imbalance in the Mojave and provide an early warning of future ecosystem disintegration, given climate models unanimously predict an increasingly dry and hot future.},

I collected comparative data on social behavior and use of tree zones, foraging surfaces, foraging methods, perch sizes, and tree species in native limestone forest and tangantangan (Leucaena leucoephala) thickets. Unlike the flocking Bridled White-eyes, Golden White-eyes were territorial, but the species were aggressive interspecifically. Bridled and Golden white-eyes were similar in their use of limestone forest and tangantangan thickets as foraging habitats. Compared with Bridled White-eyes, however, Golden White-eyes were more generalized foragers (i.e. less specialized on the top outer forest strata, on live leaves as foraging substrates, and on gleaning as a foraging tactic). Golden White-eyes also preferred to forage among dead leaves, on branches, and on fruit, and they foraged by probing. Similarities by both species in their use of limestone forest and tangantangan thickets indicate that they did not alter their foraging strategies greatly to use the different habitats. This flexibility in habitat choice may explain in part why these species have persisted in the face of periodic typhoon damage and extensive human-caused habitat change. Despite the differences in foraging ecology between the species, interspecific aggression indicated that they competed for resources. In temperate communities, species can be ecologically very similar but rarely compete; in this tropical island community, species with only general ecological similarities may still compete for resources.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic activities are the main cause of habitat loss and fragmentation, which directly affects biodiversity. Disruption in landscape connectivity among populations may affect complex interactions between species and ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, and ultimately result in secondary extinctions. Urbanization, one of the most intense forms of landscapes changes, has been reported to negatively affect bird and plant diversity. Still, little is known about the effects of urban landscapes on interaction networks. We investigated the relationship between urban landscape structure and plant-frugivore networks at different spatial scales. Coupling interaction data from urban areas and a model selection approach, we evaluated which landscape factors best explained the variation in urban networks properties. Our results indicate that urbanization decreases bird richness, mainly through the loss of habitat specialist species, which results in networks being composed mainly of birds well adapted to urban dwelling. We found that interaction evenness, a measure of homogeneity of interaction distribution between species, increases with urbanization. This is due to the strong dominance that generalist birds had in network composition because they foraged on all available fruits, including exotic plants. The ensuing homogenization of interactions can reduce the resilience of networks and affect the efficiency of ecosystems functions. Thus, urbanization plans should consider the proportion and distribution of green areas within cities, coupling human and ecosystem wellbeing.},

abstract = {The increasing number of quantitative assessments of homogenization using citizen science data is particularly important in the Neotropics, given its high biodiversity and ecological peculiarity, and whose communities may react differently to landscape changes. We looked for evidence of taxonomic homogenization in terrestrial birds by investigating patterns of beta diversity along a gradient of human-altered landscapes (HAL), trying to identify species associated with this process. We analyzed bird data from 87 sites sampled in a citizen science program in the south Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Regional-scale taxonomic homogenization was assessed by comparing beta diversity among sites in different HALs (natural, rural or urban landscapes) accounting for variation derived from geographical distance and zoogeographical affinities by georeferencing sites and determining their position in a phytogeographical domain. Beta diversity was calculated by multivariate dispersion and by testing compositional changes due to turnover and nestedness among HALs and phytogeographical domains. Finally, we assessed which species were typical for each group using indicator species analysis. Bird homogenization was indicated by decreases in beta diversity following landscape changes. Beta diversity of rural sites was roughly half that of natural habitats, while urban sites held less than 10{\%} of the natural areas' beta diversity. Species composition analysis revealed that the turnover component was important in differentiating sites depending on HAL and phytogeography; the nestedness component was important among HALs, where directional species loss is maintained even considering effects of sampling effort. A similar result was obtained among phytogeographical domains, indicating nested-pattern dissimilarity among compositions of overlapping communities. As expected, a few native generalists and non-native urban specialists were characteristic of rural and urban sites. We generated strong evidence that taxonomic homogenization occurs in the south Brazilian Atlantic Forest as a result of a directional and nested species loss, with the resultant assemblages composed of few disturbance-tolerant birds.},

abstract = {The effect of urbanization can be immense, yet our understanding is rudimentary. Here, we compile the most recent information on urban impacts on avian populations and communities. Compared to other vertebrates, birds are easily monitored by skilled observers and provide a mechanism to explore urban effects and responses to different urban designs. Taxonomically, bird communities in distinctly different habitats are most different in the least disturbed sites and the most similar in the most urbanized sites. Urbanization tends tAlterraAlterra, o select for omnivorous, granivorous, and cavity nesting species. Increased urbanization typically leads to an increase in avian biomass but a reduction in richness. Unlike most passerines, raptors may have home ranges that extend beyond the urban boundary and therefore do not need to meet all their ecological requirements within urban areas. Urban habitats are often of superior quality to raptors because there they are often free from persecution and have an adequate food supply. The processes that underlie the patterns of population and community level responses need more attention, but several areas of have been identified as being important. Birds respond to vegetation composition and structure, and urban areas that retain native vegetative characteristics retain more native species than those that do not. Avian fecundity in urban areas is a reflection of species-specific adaptability to urban resources, and to levels of nest predation and nest parasitism. Additionally, non-consumptive human activities that increase with urbanization are recognized as having negative impacts on avian populations and communities. Avian survivorship in urban areas is influenced by risk of collision with man-made objects, changes in the predator assemblage, food supply, and disease. Missing are thorough investigations in the regions of highest human population growth, e.g. Southeast Asia. Additionally, there is a paucity of information from regions of high avian diversity, e.g. tropical forests. Clearly, local knowledge and study is required before implementation of management policies to reduce urban impacts on bird communities. Hopefully, such policies will include long-term monitoring. Demographic parameters of fecundity and survivorship need to be examined in conjunction with measures of community diversity and density across the urban gradient to better understand the quality of different urban habitats, and the variation of quality among spatial patterns of urbanization within the native habitat matrix. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This has resulted in a vast decrease of shrubs cover on the fixed sand dunes, which changes along the rainfall gradient. In the north, an average of 27{\%} of the shrubs had wilted by 2009, and in the drier southern area, 68{\%} of the shrubs had withered. This loss of shrubbery is not expected to induce dune remobilization because the existing bio-crust cover is not negatively affected by the drought.

Principal Components Analysis on data from used and random microhabitat locations produced two axes we retained for analysis related with two key factors: cover-visibility and food availability. Non-parametric kernel density functions were calculated for each of the PCA axes and species (or sexes), and niche overlap estimated as the area shared between species' density functions. Null models were run to evaluate overlap significance. In analyses of microhabitat selection by the six sets of birds, 13 out of 15 pairs had significant resource partitioning and niche segregation, except for the pairs partridge and female Great Bustard and the two sexes of Great Bustard. Eurasian Stone-curlew showed wider trophic niche breadth, although segregated from the other species, probably because of its higher invertebrate requirements. Great and Little Bustards segregated in both niche axes, selecting microhabitat according to their body size. Accessibility to food resources and shelter seems to be similar for partridges and female Great Bustards, overlapping in their selection, which may indicate the existence of segregation in other niche factors (e.g., feeding habits). Great Bustard males showed niche overlap with females. Little Bustard males showed feeding microhabitat selection patterns similar to those of females, although they preferred more open microhabitats to meet their sexual display requirements. The entire assemblage had significantly less overlap than expected by chance, suggesting that differential microhabitat selection and realized niche partitioning may explain coexistence in steppe bird communities. Our results suggest that the maintenance of different microhabitat structure should be a priority in the management of agricultural environments.},

abstract = {This article examines the effects of crowding in a market center on rates of change in organizational niche width and on organizational mortality. It proposes that, although firms with wide niches benefit from risk spreading and economies of scale, they are simultaneously exposed to intense competition. An analysis of organizational dynamics in automobile manufacturing firms in France, Germany, and Great Britain shows that competitive pressure not only increases the hazard of disbanding but also prompts organizational transformations that give rise to processes of resource partitioning. Emphasizing the content/process distinction in conceptualizing organizational change, the article finds that the process effect of changes in niche width and position increases mortality hazards. We discuss our findings in light of the processes investigated by the ecological theories of density dependence, resource partitioning, and structural inertia, and point to the theoretical links that help to integrate these theories.},

abstract = {In dryland systems, shrubs often increase the productivity, abundance, and diversity of understory plants, however these positive interactions can also scale to other trophic levels. The facilitative effect of Larrea tridentata was hypothesized to extend beyond plants to the local insect community in the Mojave Desert. Pan traps were placed under shrubs and in open microsites to test the following predictions: 1) shrub-annual facilitation complexes increase insect abundance, richness, and diversity; and 2) specific insect families or functional groups respond to the shrub-annual facilitation complex more strongly due to increased resources. Abundance, richness, and diversity of the insect communities associated with shrubs were significantly greater in shrub compared to open microsites. The families Sphecidae, Formicidae, Bradynobaenidae and Lauxaniidae were positively associated with shrubs while Scarabaeidae was associated with open microsites. However, there was no difference in the relative abundances of major functional groups, suggesting that the primary pollinators for this ecosystem are not sensitive to differences in floral resources at this scale. This study demonstrates that shrubs facilitate local insect communities and supports the hypothesis that plant-plant facilitation can extend to other trophic levels. Management of desert shrubs is thus an effective means to enhance many components of insect biodiversity.},

abstract = {Preservation of desert ecosystems is a worldwide conservation priority. Shrubs can play a key role in the structure of desert communities and can function as foundation species. Understanding desert shrub ecology is therefore an important task in desert conservation. A useful model for the function of shrubs in deserts is ecological facilitation, which explores benefits that shrubs confer on their community. Facilitation has been well developed in the context of shrub–plant interactions but less well studied for plant–animal interactions. We used radiotelemetry to test the hypothesis that a dominant desert shrub facilitates one species of diurnal lizard. We hypothesized that the blunt-nosed leopard lizard Gambelia sila would spend some part of its daily activity cycle associated with California jointfir Ephedra californica, and that lizard association with shrubs would increase during the afternoon peak temperature period. We relocated lizards three times daily for 24 days and scored whether lizards were within 0.5 m of a shrub, which we used as an indicator of shrub association. For each relocation, we also scored lizard association with a set of predefined microhabitat features. We also scored lizard behavior according to a set of predefined behavioral traits. We constructed home ranges following the minimum convex polygon method and generated estimates of shrub density and relative shrub area within each home range polygon. We obtained 1,190 datapoints from a sample of 27 lizards. We found that lizards were associated with open sites significantly more often than with shrubs but were associated with shrubs more than predicted by percent shrub area within their home ranges. Lizards were associated significantly more often under shrubs during the afternoon peak temperature period, and lizards were observed cooling under shrubs significantly more often. The frequency of association of individual lizards with shrubs was not correlated with the density of shrubs within their home range. Synthesis and Applications. Shrubs can be considered as a component of high-quality habitat for ectothermic desert vertebrates for the purposes of restoration and management. Furthermore, radiotelemetry provides a novel methodological approach for assessing shrub–animal facilitative interactions within desert communities.},

abstract = {Climate change-induced droughts have contributed to large-scale die-offs of dominant tree species throughout much of the southwestern United States. These mortality events provide ecologists with the opportunity to determine whether afterlife effects associated with the die-off occur and the potential implications for future ecosystem changes. We studied both the afterlife and interaction effects of condition (dead trees, living trees, and open areas) on understory vegetation in a Juniperus monosperma woodland of northern Arizona 7 years after a major mortality event. Five major findings resulted: (1) there was a positive afterlife effect on understory plants, in which vegetation under dead junipers contained almost double the amount of cover; (2) the competitive effect on understory plants was exemplified by a 1.3 times greater cover and 1.6 additional species in open areas compared to under living junipers; (3) plant community composition significantly differed by aspect and condition; (4) the highly invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) was 1.5 times greater under dead junipers compared to live junipers; and (5) litter depth and light availability were negatively and positively correlated with plant cover, respectively, but weakly correlated with afterlife effects. Our results indicate that mortality events can promote changes in understory vegetation through afterlife effects. In ecosystems where foundation species suffer high rates of mortality, changes in plant population dynamics and ecosystem function may promote an altered trajectory in community composition with the potential to increase the presence of invasive species. Continued species die-offs associated with climate change-induced drought may contribute to an increased occurrence and legacy of afterlife effects. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The effects of the present biodiversity crisis have been largely focused on the loss of species. However, a missed component of biodiversity loss that often accompanies or even precedes species disappearance is the extinction of ecological interactions. Here, we propose a novel model that (i) relates the diversity of both species and interactions along a gradient of environmental deterioration and (ii) explores how the rate of loss of ecological functions, and consequently of ecosystem services, can be accelerated or restrained depending on how the rate of species loss covaries with the rate of interactions loss. We find that the loss of species and interactions are decoupled, such that ecological interactions are often lost at a higher rate. This implies that the loss of ecological interactions may occur well before species disappearance, affecting species functionality and ecosystems services at a faster rate than species extinctions. We provide a number of empirical case studies illustrating these points. Our approach emphasizes the importance of focusing on species interactions as the major biodiversity component from which the 'health' of ecosystems depends.},

abstract = {A humped-back relationship between species richness and community biomass has frequently been observed in plant communities, at both local and regional scales, although often improperly called a productivity-diversity relationship. Explanations for this relationship have emphasized the role of competitive exclusion, probably because at the time when the relationship was first examined, competition was considered to be the significant biotic filter structuring plant communities. However, over the last 15 years there has been a renewed interest in facilitation and this research has shown a clear link between the role of facilitation in structuring communities and both community biomass and the severity of the environment. Although facilitation may enlarge the realized niche of species and increase community richness in stressful environments, there has only been one previous attempt to revisit the humped-back model of species richness and to include facilitative processes. However, to date, no model has explored whether biotic interactions can potentially shape both sides of the humped-back model for species richness commonly detected in plant communities. Here, we propose a revision of Grime's original model that incorporates a new understanding of the role of facilitative interactions in plant communities. In this revised model, facilitation promotes diversity at medium to high environmental severity levels, by expanding the realized niche of stress-intolerant competitive species into harsh physical conditions. However, when environmental conditions become extremely severe the positive effects of the benefactors wane (as supported by recent research on facilitative interactions in extremely severe environments) and diversity is reduced. Conversely, with decreasing stress along the biomass gradient, facilitation decreases because stress-intolerant species become able to exist away from the canopy of the stress-tolerant species (as proposed by facilitation theory). At the same time competition increases for stress-tolerant species, reducing diversity in the most benign conditions (as proposed by models of competition theory). In this way our inclusion of facilitation into the classic model of plant species diversity and community biomass generates a more powerful and richer predictive framework for understanding the role of plant interactions in changing diversity. We then use our revised model to explain both the observed discrepancies between natural patterns of species richness and community biomass and the results of experimental studies of the impact of biodiversity on the productivity of herbaceous communities. It is clear that explicit consideration of concurrent changes in stress-tolerant and competitive species enhances our capacity to explain and interpret patterns in plant community diversity with respect to environmental severity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Frugivores often track ripe fruit abundance closely across local areas despite the ephemeral and typically patchy distributions of this resource. We use spatial auto- and cross-correlation analyses to quantify spatial patterns of fruit abundance and avian frugivory across a 4-month period within a forested 4.05-ha study grid in Puerto Rico. Analyses focused on two tanager species, Spindalis portoricensis and Nesospingus speculiferus, and their principal food plants. Three broad questions are addressed: (1) at what spatial scales is fruit abundance and frugivory patchy; (2) at what spatial scales do frugivores respond to fruit abundance; and (3) to what extent do spatial patterns of frugivory overlap between bird species? Fruit patch size, species composition, and heterogeneity was variable among months, despite fruit patch locations remaining relatively consistent between months. Positive correlations between frugivory and fruit abundance suggested tanagers successfully tracked fruit abundance. Frugivory was, however, more localized than fruit abundance. Scales of spatial overlap in frugivory and monthly variation in the foraging locations of the two tanager species suggested that interspecific facilitation may have been important in determining bird foraging locations. In particular, S. portoricensis, a specialist frugivore, may have relied on the loud calls of the gregarious generalist, N. speculiferus, to find new foraging areas. Such a mechanism could help explain the formation of mixed species feeding flocks and highlights the potential importance of facilitation between species that share resources. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {The role of scale in ecology is widely recognized as being of vital importance for understanding ecological patterns and processes. The capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) is a forest grouse species with large spatial requirements and highly specialized habitat preferences. Habitat models at the forest stand scale can only partly explain capercaillie occurrence, and some studies at the landscape scale have emphasized the role of large-scale effects. We hypothesized that both the ability of single variables and multivariate models to explain capercaillie occurrence would vary with the spatial scale of the analysis. To test this hypothesis, we varied the grain size of our analysis from 1 to just over 1100 hectares and built univariate and multivariate habitat suitability models for capercaillie in the Swiss Alps. The variance explained by the univariate models was found to vary among the predictors and with spatial scale. Within the multivariate models, the best single-scale model (using all predictor variables at the same scale) worked at a scale equivalent to a small annual home range. The multi-scale model, in which each predictor variable was entered at the scale at which it had performed best in the univariate model, did slightly better than the best single-scale model. Our results confirm that habitat variables should be included at different spatial scales when species-habitat relationships are investigated. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

Information about how spatial (e.g., vegetation) and temporal factors influence nest survival of these sparrows is lacking throughout their range. Our objective was to examine the spatial and temporal factors associated with nest survival of Black-throated Sparrows at the nest and nest-patch scales in the predator-rich environment of the northern Chihuahuan Desert of New Mexico. We used a logistic-exposure model fit within a Bayesian framework to model the daily survival probability of Black-throated Sparrow nests. Predation was the leading cause of nest failure, accounting for 86{\%} of failed nests. We found evidence of negative associations between nest survival and both vegetative cover above nests and shrub density within 5 m of nests. We found no support for other habitat covariates, but did find strong evidence that daily survival rate was higher earlier in the breeding season and during the egg-laying stage. A decline in nest survival later in the breeding period may be due to increased predator activity due to warmer ambient temperatures, whereas lower survival during the incubation and nestling stages could be a result of increased activity at nests. A generalist approach to nest-site selection may be an adaptive response to the presence of a diverse assemblage of nest predators that results in the reduced influence of spatial factors on nest survival for Black-throated Sparrows.},

abstract = {We approach the problem of the evolution of bird migration by asking whether migration evolves towards new breeding areas or towards survival areas in the non-breeding season. Thus, we avoid the ambiguity of the usually discussed "southern-home-theory" or "northern-home-theory". We argue that migration evolved in birds that spread to seasonal habitats through gradual dispersal to enhance survival during the non-breeding season; this in contrast to the alternative idea suggesting that migration evolved towards new breeding areas to increase reproductive success. Our synthesis is based on the threshold model explaining how migratory traits can change rapidly through microevolutionary processes. Our model brings former theories together and explains how bird migration, with the appropriate direction and time program, evolves through selection after genetically non-directed events such as dispersal and colonization. The model does not need the former untested assumptions such as competition as a reason for migration and for the disappearance of sedentary populations or higher reproductive success in temperate breeding areas. Our theory offers answers to questions such as how birds with a southern origin may gradually reach northern latitudes, why migration routes may follow historical expansion routes and why birds leave an area for the non-breeding season and move back instead of breeding on their wintering grounds. The theory proposes gradual change through selection and not sudden changes such as long distance dispersal or mutations and can be applied to migration at all latitudes and in all directions. The scenario provides a reasonable concept to understand most of the existing migratory phenomena on the basis of the ecology and genetics of migratory behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Twice a year, normally diurnal songbirds engage in long-distance nocturnal migrations between their wintering and breeding grounds. If and how songbirds sleep during these periods of increased activity has remained a mystery. We used a combination of electrophysiological recording and neurobehavioral testing to characterize seasonal changes in sleep and cognition in captive white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) across nonmigratory and migratory seasons. Compared to sparrows in a nonmigratory state, migratory sparrows spent approximately two-thirds less time sleeping. Despite reducing sleep during migration, accuracy and responding on a repeated-acquisition task remained at a high level in sparrows in a migratory state. This resistance to sleep loss during the prolonged migratory season is in direct contrast to the decline in accuracy and responding observed following as little as one night of experimenter-induced sleep restriction in the same birds during the nonmigratory season. Our results suggest that despite being adversely affected by sleep loss during the nonmigratory season, songbirds exhibit an unprecedented capacity to reduce sleep during migration for long periods of time without associated deficits in cognitive function. Understanding the mechanisms that mediate migratory sleeplessness may provide insights into the etiology of changes in sleep and behavior in seasonal mood disorders, as well as into the functions of sleep itself.},

abstract = {—This study was initiated to evaluate nesting mortality of birds as a feature of the environment and as a selective force in the evolu- tion of reproductive strategies. Representative nesting-success data from the literature for most groups of birds were transformed into daily mortality rates to eliminate dif- ferences among species in the length of the nest cycle. These data are presented by taxonomic groupings and for passerines by geographical region and nest construction and placement. The strength and pattern of various mortality factors are described in detail. Predation, starvation, desertion, hatching failure, and adverse weather are the most prevalent factors, but nestsite competition, brood parasitism, and arthropod infestation may be important in some species. It is demonstrated that the various mortality factors can be identified by characteristic patterns of nesting losses involving differences in mortality rates between the egg and nestling periods and the within-nest component of mortality rates. Among Temperate Zone passerines, field-nesting and marsh-nesting species have the highest mortality rates while those species nesting in trees, especially in cavities, enjoy higher success. Starvation is prevalent in marsh and field species but desertion is more restricted to tree-nesting species. In general, arctic species have lower mortality rates and tropical species higher rates, although there is a similar gradient from arid to humid regions within the tropics. The relative abundance of a species is related directly to its mortality rate in arctic regions, but is not in temperate and tropical regions. Birds of prey generally have low mortality rates although starvation is often a major factor. Nesting losses in seabirds are caused primarily by crowded conditions in colonies and loss of eggs due to inadequate nest construction. Chick deaths come about primarily through their wandering away from parental care which is most common in the semiprecocial Charadriiformes. Precocial shorebirds and water birds enjoy higher egg success than ground-nesting passerines but game birds exhibit similar mortality rates. Little is known of the survival of precocial chicks after hatching except that mortality rates may be initially quite high and decrease with age. The fate of altricial birds after fledging is also poorly documented. It is postulated that interspecific differences in mortality rates are determined by evolutionarily acceptable levels of adult risk to lower mortality rates of offspring through parental care, adult adaptations of morphology and behavior for foraging which result in limitations on nesting adaptations, environmental unpredictability which reduces the effectiveness of adaptations, and—most import—the diversity of predators to which a species must adapt.},

Migration is highly demanding, and given its cyclical nature, we currently know that it has substantial effects on the population parameters of migratory birds during both breeding and wintering seasons. However, the potential effects of the presence of migratory birds in their wintering grounds on populations of resident birds have remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose the hypothesis that migratory birds negatively affect the habitat occupancy and population abundance of resident birds because of the arrival of numerous individuals during the most limiting months of the year. Here, we studied different species of migratory and resident birds that coexist during winter in an urban ecological reserve located within Mexico City. We used single-species multiseason occupancy models, two-species occupancy models, and distance sampling techniques to evaluate changes in occupancy and population density of resident bird species during three consecutive winters. We found an aggregation pattern between two resident species (Psaltriparus minimus and Thryomanes bewickii) with three migratory warblers (Cardellina pusilla, Setophaga coronata and Setophaga townsendi). Thus, our results provide evidence of the formation of mixed-species flocks in our study area. We also conclude that resident birds experience different demographic and behavioral processes during winter that not necessarily result from interspecific interactions with migratory birds.},

abstract = {Background. Ecological communities are dynamic collections whose composition and structure change over time, making up complex interspecific interaction networks. Mutualistic plant-animal networks can be approached through complex network analysis; these networks are characterized by a nested structure consisting of a core of generalist species, which endows the network with stability and robustness against disturbance. Those mutualistic network structures can vary as a consequence of seasonal fluctuations and food availability, as well as the arrival of new species into the system that might disorder the mutualistic network structure (e.g., a decrease in nested pattern). However, there is no assessment on how the arrival of migratory species into seasonal tropical systems can modify such patterns. Emergent and fine structural temporal patterns are adressed here for the first time for plant-frugivorous bird networks in a highly seasonal tropical environment. Methods. In a plant-frugivorous bird community, we analyzed the temporal turnover of bird species comprising the network core and periphery of ten temporal interaction networks resulting from different bird migration periods. Additionally, we evaluated how fruit abundance and richness, as well as the arrival of migratory birds into the system, explained the temporal changes in network parameters such as network size, connectance, nestedness, specialization, interaction strength asymmetry and niche overlap. The analysis included data from 10 quantitative plant-frugivorous bird networks registered from November 2013 to November 2014. Results. We registered a total of 319 interactions between 42 plant species and 44 frugivorous bird species; only ten bird species were part of the network core. We witnessed a noteworthy turnover of the species comprising the network periphery during migration periods, as opposed to the network core, which did not show significant temporal changes in species composition. Our results revealed that migration and fruit richness explain the temporal variations in network size, connectance, nestedness and interaction strength asymmetry. On the other hand, fruit abundance only explained connectance and nestedness. Discussion. By means of a fine-resolution temporal analysis, we evidenced for the first time how temporal changes in the interaction network structure respond to the arrival of migratory species into the system and to fruit availability. Additionally, few migratory bird species are important links for structuring networks, while most of them were peripheral species. We showed the relevance of studying bird-plant interactions at fine temporal scales, considering changing scenarios of species composition with a quantitative network approach.},

abstract = {Background Co-flowering plant species frequently share pollinators. Pollinator sharing is often detrimental to one or more of these species, leading to competition for pollination. Perhaps because it offers an intriguing juxtaposition of ecological opposites - mutualism and competition - within one relatively tractable system, competition for pollination has captured the interest of ecologists for over a century. Scope Our intent is to contemplate exciting areas for further work on competition for pollination, rather than to exhaustively review past studies. After a brief historical summary, we present a conceptual framework that incorporates many aspects of competition for pollination, involving both the quantity and quality of pollination services, and both female and male sex functions of flowers. Using this framework, we contemplate a relatively subtle mechanism of competition involving pollen loss, and consider how competition might affect plant mating systems, overall reproductive success and multi-species interactions. We next consider how competition for pollination might be altered by several emerging consequences of a changing planet, including the spread of alien species, climate change and pollinator declines. Most of these topics represent new frontiers whose exploration has just begun. Conclusions Competition for pollination has served as a model for the integration of ecological and evolutionary perspectives in the study of species interactions. Its study has elucidated both obvious and more subtle mechanisms, and has documented a range of outcomes. However, the potential for this interaction to inform our understanding of both pure and applied aspects of pollination biology has only begun to be realized.},

abstract = {Foraging by two species of territorial male hummingbirds was studied at clumps of scarlet gilia, Ipomopsis aggregata, inflorescences. The birds visited relatively few clumps per foraging bout, and visit frequency among clumps was not different from random (Poisson) expectations on 30 of 34 days. Birds did not forage randomly on 4 days, usually because certain clumps were revisited more than expected. Visits to inflorescences within clumps also generally were not different from random, suggesting little or no within-clump visit patterning. Randomness of foraging at the scale of clumps from day to day was associated significantly with foraging randomness at the scale of individual inflorescences, on the same territories. Visits were significantly more frequent to clumps with more inflorescences. The location of clumps relative to perches used between bouts frequently influenced where bouts started, but where bouts ended had little influence on the subsequent perch. Thus, randomness of foraging at clumps based on visit frequencies was compounded of differences in visits based on clump characteristics and the frequency distribution of those characteristics in the observation area. These results, coupled with studies of within and between inflorescence foraging, suggest that the primary mechanism for foraging at plants that have accumulated the most nectar per flower involves area-restricted search with differential response to low and high rewards encountered during a foraging bout. Some difficulties of testing for, non-random foraging in natural situations are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Staging areas and migratory stopovers of wetland birds can function as geographic bottlenecks; common dependence among migratory wetland bird species on these sites has major implications for wetland conservation. Although 90 of playa wetlands in the Rainwater Basin (RWB) region of Nebraska, USA, have been destroyed, the area still provides essential stopover habitat for up to 10 million waterfowl each spring. Our objectives were to determine local (within wetland and immediate watershed) and landscape-scale factors influencing wetland bird abundance and species richness during spring migration at RWB playas. We surveyed 3640 playas twice weekly in the RWB and observed approximately 1.6 million individual migratory wetland birds representing 72 species during spring migrations 2002-2004. We tested a priori hypotheses about whether local and landscape variables influenced overall species richness and abundance of geese, dabbling ducks, diving ducks, and shoreb irds. Wetland area had a positive influence on goose abundance in all years, whereas percent emergent vegetation and hunting pressure had negative influences. Models predicting dabbling duck abundance differed among years; however, individual wetland area and area of semipermanent wetlands within 10 km of the study wetland consistently had a positive influence on dabbling duck abundance. Percent emergent vegetation also was a positive predictor of dabbling duck abundance in all years, indicating that wetlands with intermediate (50) vegetation coverage have the greatest dabbling duck abundance. Shorebird abundance was positively influenced by wetland area and number of wetlands within 10 km and negatively influenced by water depth. Wetland area, water depth, and area of wetlands within 10 km were all equally important in models predicting overall species richness. Total species richness was positively influenced by wetland area and negatively influenced by water depth and area of semipermanent wetlands within 10 km. Avian species richness also was greatest in wetlands with intermediate vegetation coverage. Restoring playa hydrology should promote intermediate percent cover of emergent vegetation, which will increase use by dabbling ducks and shorebirds, and decrease snow goose (Chen caerulescens) use of these wetlands. We observed a reduction in dabbling duck abundance on wetlands open to spring snow goose hunting and recommend further investigation of the effects of this conservation order on nontarget species. Our results indicate that wildlife managers at migration stopover areas should conserve wetlands in complexes to meet the continuing and future habitat requirements of migratory birds, especially dabbling ducks, during spring migration. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Wildlife Society.},

Patterns of animal space use may vary according to species identity, presence of conspecifics, presence of heterospecifics, and resource availability. We evaluated joint space use by Canyon Wrens (Catherpes mexicanus) and Rock Wrens (Salpinctes obsoletus) by comparing home range sizes, home range overlap, and foraging behavior. Canyon and Rock wrens are ecologically similar species which frequently co-occur along rocky cliffs where members of both species feed on terrestrial invertebrates. Interactions between Canyon and Rock wrens provide information about avian space use and foraging strategies in understudied cliff habitats. We estimated home range for each species using ArcGIS, and quantified foraging microhabitat use. Canyon Wren home ranges were widely spaced, did not overlap conspecifics, and were significantly larger than those of Rock Wrens. Rock Wrens occurred at higher densities and home ranges overlapped conspecifics in 33{\%} of cases by an average of 19{\%}. Canyon and Rock wren home ranges overlapped in 68{\%} of cases by an average of 28{\%}, but overlapping pairs rarely shared core use areas. The two species differed significantly in foraging microhabitat use. Results suggest that heterospecific territory defense between Canyon and Rock wrens is low, and that these species have adopted different methods for using shared resources in escarpment and cliff habitats.},

Yet, variation in management of gardens (e.g., garden size, number of tree and shrub species, ground cover) and the landscape (e.g., urban cover, landscape diversity) that surrounds them may alter communities within gardens. We examined how garden management and landscape features influence bird abundance, richness, species composition, and traits in 19 urban community gardens in the central coast of California. We found that bird abundance was higher in larger gardens and in gardens with more grass, and species richness was higher in larger gardens. Bird abundance also differed with garden ecoregion. Urban cover influenced bird species composition while bird trait distributions were influenced by urban cover, ecoregion, and grass cover. Gardens with more urban cover supported fewer insectivores, ground-nesters, and forest-associated birds, higher nesting height and more urban-associated bird species. Gardens in the ecoregion closer to the coast had more cliff nesters and more marsh-associated birds. Although urban cover and ecoregion were important for the composition and trait distribution of birds, manipulation of garden management and size may promote bird species richness, or abundance of functionally important birds in gardens.},

For insectivorous migrants, cues associated with vegetative phenology (e.g. flowering, leaf flush, and leaf loss) may reliably predict the availability of herbivorous arthropods. Here we examined whether migrants use the phenology of five tree species to choose stopover locations, and whether phenology accurately predicts food availability. 3. Using a combination of experimental and observational evidence, we show migrant populations closely track tree phenology, particularly the flowering phenology of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and preferentially forage in trees with more flowers. Furthermore, the flowering phenology of honey mesquite reliably predicts overall arthropod abundance as well as the arthropods preferred by migrants for food. 4. Together, these results suggest that honey mesquite flowering phenology is an important cue used by migrants to assess food availability quickly and reliably, while in transit during spring migration. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {1. The habitat use and diet of skylarks wintering on lowland farms were studied to assess whether changes in agricultural practice could have reduced their most favoured wintering habitats or foods. Faecal samples were collected and soil seed densities were estimated. Skylarks in 122 cereal stubble fields in Oxfordshire were counted monthly to examine habitat use. 2. Cereal stubble fields were more likely to be occupied than other crops, and densities of birds in occupied fields were high. Barley stubbles were significantly more likely to be occupied than wheat stubbles. Growing cereals were weakly selected. Sugar beet stubbles held high densities of birds. Rotational set-aside was occupied more frequently and held higher densities than non-rotational set-aside. 3. Field size affected field occupancy independently of crop type, with larger fields more likely to be occupied. Fields enclosed by hedges or trees tended to be avoided. Cereal and set-aside fields that were occupied by skylarks in at least 1 month held significantly higher soil seed densities than fields that were not occupied. 4. Differences in occupancy between crops could be explained by diet. Birds in cereal stubbles fed largely on cereal grain, whereas those in winter cereals fed largely on cereal leaves. Broad-leaved weed leaves were strongly selected as food in cereal crops and farmland grass fields. In grass fields, the proportion of the diet made up by broad-leaved weeds was positively correlated with their availability. Broad-leaved weed seeds did not make up a significant dietary component in any crop. 5. Our results show that the shift from spring to autumn sowing of cereals has led to a loss of the skylark's most strongly selected wintering habitat and best food source. In winter cereals and in grass there was a high selectivity for relatively scarce, and probably declining, food resources. Our results suggest that the retention of weed-rich cereal (particularly barley) and sugar beet stubbles through the winter, particularly in large open blocks, will improve conditions for skylarks in winter. Whole-field rotational set-aside, particularly as naturally regenerating cereal stubbles, provides good winter food resources for skylarks.},

abstract = {Most of our understanding of habitat use by migrating land birds comes from studies conducted at single, small spatial scales, which may overemphasize the importance of intrinsic habitat factors, such as food availability, in shaping migrant distributions. We believe that a multi-scale approach is essential to assess the influence of factors that control en route habitat use. We determined the relative importance of eight variables, each operating at a habitat-patch, landscape, or regional spatial scale, in explaining the differential use of hardwood forests by Nearctic-Neotropical land birds during migration. We estimated bird densities through transect surveys at sites near the Mississippi coast during spring and autumn migration within landscapes with variable amounts of hardwood forest cover. At a regional scale, migrant density increased with proximity to the coast, which was of moderate importance in explaining bird densities, probably due to constraints imposed on migrants when negotiating the Gulf of Mexico. The amount of hardwood forest cover at a landscape scale was positively correlated with arthropod abundance and had the greatest importance in explaining densities of all migrants, as a group, during spring, and of insectivorous migrants during autumn. Among landscape scales ranging from 500 m to 10 km radius, the densities of migrants were, on average, most strongly and positively related to the amount of hardwood forest cover within a 5 km radius. We suggest that hardwood forest cover at this scale may be an indicator of habitat quality that migrants use as a cue when landing at the end of a migratory flight. At the patch scale, direct measures of arthropod abundance and plant community composition were also important in explaining migrant densities, whereas habitat structure was of little importance. The relative amount of fleshy-fruited trees was positively related and was the most important variable explaining frugivorous migrant density during autumn. Although constraints extrinsic to habitat had a moderate role in explaining migrant distributions, our results are consistent with the view that food availability is the ultimate factor shaping the distributions of birds during stopover. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Small mammal microhabitat research has greatly influenced vertebrate community ecologists. There exists a ‘‘microhabitat paradigm'' that states that sympatry among small mammal species is enabled by differential use of microhabitat (i.e., microhabitat partitioning). However, several studies have failed to detect microhabitat partitioning, and research has consistently indicated that microhabitat phenomena do not explain larger spatial scale (i.e., macrohabitat) variation. Possible reasons for these difficult to reconcile observations are explored by reviewing and tabulating data from 70 studies. The meaning of the term microhabitat has changed subtly since 1969. This review demonstrates that the existing knowledge of small mammal microhabitat partitioning is highly concentrated among small-scale studies, conducted with modest intensity, that measure microhabitat at inappropriate spatial scales. This concentration of knowledge appears to be an insufficient foundation on which to accept microhabitat partitioning as a widely generalizable phenomenon. The observation that microhabitat phenomena do not explain larger spatial scale variation suggests the importance of underappreciated adaptive mechanisms that relate to the ability of species to coexist, use habitat, and ultimately persist},

abstract = {Habitat suitability models can be generated using methods requiring information on species presence or species presence and absence. Knowledge of the predictive performance of such methods becomes a critical issue to establish their optimal scope of application for mapping current species distributions under different constraints. Here, we use breeding bird atlas data in Catalonia as a working example and attempt to analyse the relative performance of two methods: the Ecological Niche factor Analysis (ENFA) using presence data only and Generalised Linear Models (GLM) using presence/absence data. Models were run on a set of forest species with similar habitat requirements, but with varying occurrence rates (prevalence) and niche positions (marginality). Our results support the idea that GLM predictions are more accurate than those obtained with ENFA. This was particularly true when species were using available habitats proportionally to their suitability, making absence data reliable and useful to enhance model calibration. Species marginality in niche space was also correlated to predictive accuracy, i.e. species with less restricted ecological requirements were modelled less accurately than species with more restricted requirements. This pattern was irrespective of the method employed. Models for wide-ranging and tolerant species were more sensitive to absence data, suggesting that presence/absence methods may be particularly important for predicting distributions of this type of species. We conclude that modellers should consider that species ecological characteristics are critical in determining the accuracy of models and that it is difficult to predict generalist species distributions accurately and this is independent of the method used. Being based on distinct approaches regarding adjustment to data and data quality, habitat distribution modelling methods cover different application areas, making it difficult to identify one that should be universally applicable. Our results suggest however, that if absence data is available, methods using this information should be preferably used in most situations.},

abstract = {Each species generally has a close relationship with one or more habitats and can therefore be classified as either specialist or generalist. We studied whether specialist and generalist species are spatially distributed independently of each other. Repeating the analysis for 100 of the most frequent terrestrial bird species recorded over the 10 000 sampled sites of the French Breeding Bird survey, we found that specialists were more abundant if the rest of the community was specialized, and that the inverse was also true. This pattern was far subtler than just a simple dichotomy: most species actually presented a maximum abundance at a value of community specialization similar to their own level of specialization. Bird communities appear very well defined along a specialist-generalist gradient. We believe this pattern becomes more apparent with habitat degradation. The consequences on both ecological services and community resilience may well be considerable. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {The distribution of desert mistletoes (Phoradendron californicum) among mesquite (Prosopis velutina) hosts is significantly aggregated. We hypothesized that the aggregation of mistletoes among hosts is produced by the pattern of seed rain generated by seed dispersers. We tested whether frugivorous Phainopeplas (Phainopepla nitens) foraged preferentially, and hence deposited mistletoe seeds disproportionately, in already parasitized mesquites. We found that Phainopeplas favored parasitized tall trees as perching and feeding sites and deposited mistletoe seeds disproportionately on trees with these characteristics. To assess experimentally the effect of the presence of mistletoes on seed deposition, we removed mistletoes from host trees. Before mistletoe removal, seed deposition was equivalent and temporally correlated in pairs of control and removal trees. After removal, deposition was lower into removal trees than into unmanipulated trees. Although mistletoe removal resulted in lower seed deposition, it did not eliminate it. We inferred that seed deposition into parasitized hosts can result from deposition of seeds originating from within a host and from other infected hosts. We conclude that the response of seed-dispersing birds to mistietoes leads to disproportionate seed deposition into already parasitized trees and that the heterogeneous distribution of seeds among hosts created by birds contributes to the clumped distribution of mistletoes among hosts.},

abstract = {The lacertid lizard Podarcis hispanica atrata maintained remarkably constant body temperatures (Tb) throughout its daily activity period in early autumn, despite significant variability in available operative temperatures (Tc). Lizard Tbs were substantially closer to the species' selected temperature range (the target Tbs for thermoregulation, estimated by the central 80{\%} of the temperatures selected in a laboratory photothermal gradient) than were a random sample of Tcs, indicating that this population thermoregulates both accurately and effectively. We compared observed behaviors and Tbs to the predictions of two hypotheses. The "no thermoregulation" null hypothesis predicted that lizard activity and microsite use would be unaffected by thermal constraints. The "only thermoregulation" hypothesis predicted that lizards would be active only at those times and in those places where Tcs fell within the selected temperature range. To evaluate the contributions of various behavioral adjustments (activity times, use of microhabitats and sun-shade patches, basking, and shuttling) to temperature regulation, we combined results from direct behavioral observations with information on the Tcs available at different times of day and in different microsites (combinations of structural microhabitats and sun-shade patches). Lizard activity patterns did not match the predictions of either hypothesis, but the observed pattern of activity produced Tbs that were, on average, 1.0°C closer to the selected temperature range than were Tbs predicted by the "no thermoregulation" hypothesis. The lizards' use of microsites (combinations of structural microhabitats and sun-shade patches) was more similar to predictions of the "no thermoregulation" hypothesis than to those of the "only thermoregulation" hypothesis. Nevertheless, the lizards' use of specific microsites produced Tbs that were, on average, 1.9°C closer to the selected temperature range than were randomly available Tcs. The relative contributions of different behavioral mechanisms varied with time of day. In the early morning, low movement rates, selection of sunny microsites, and most notably, adoption of a basking posture contributed to temperature regulation. In the late morning and early afternoon, no thermoregulatory behaviors were necessary, as indicated by randomly positioned models that achieved mean Tcs within the selected temperature range. At midday, frequent movements between sunny and shaded microsites probably reduced heat loads on lizards, preventing Tbs from exceeding the selected temperature range. In the late afternoon, nonrandom use of microsites and basking behavior appeared to contribute equally to the elevation of Tbs above randomly sampled Tcs.},

abstract = {The number of flowers open at any one time on a plant, i.e., floral display size, varies greatly among plant species. For example, some species flower during a brief period and have many open flowers, while others have extended flowering with only a few open flowers at one time (Gentry 1974; Bawa 1983). Also, floral display size often varies among individuals of the same plant species (e.g., Willson {\&} Price 1977; Pleasants {\&} Zimmerman 1990). The causes of such variations in floral display size are enduring interest to plant ecologists (reviewed by de Jong et al. 1992). Numerous studies have reported that variation in floral display size produces marked alterations in pollinator behavior. Especially, two types of pollinator response to increased floral display size have been recognized from the perspective of their influences on pollen dispersal. First, larger floral displays attract more pollinators per unit of time (Fig 14.1A; reviewed by Ohashi {\&} Yahara 1998). This will promote cross-pollination in terms of increased pollen receipt, removal, or potential mate diversity (Harder {\&} Barrett 1996). Second, the number of flowers that individual pollinators probe per plant also increases with floral display size (Fig. 14.1B; also reviewed by Ohashi {\&} Yahara 1998). This will increase self-pollination among flowers on the same plant (“geitonogamy”; Richards 1986; de Jong et al. 1993). Thus, variation in floral display size may lead to a substantial difference in pollen dispersal and, in turn, plant fitness.},

abstract = {Biodiversity, a multidimensional property of natural systems, is difficult to quantify partly because of the multitude of indices proposed for this purpose. Indices aim to describe general properties of communities that allow us to compare different regions, taxa, and trophic levels. Therefore, they are of fundamental importance for environmental monitoring and conservation, although there is no consensus about which indices are more appropriate and informative. We tested several common diversity indices in a range of simple to complex statistical analyses in order to determine whether some were better suited for certain analyses than others. We used data collected around the focal plant Plantago lanceolata on 60 temperate grassland plots embedded in an agricultural landscape to explore relationships between the common diversity indices of species richness (S), Shannon's diversity (H'), Simpson's diversity (D1), Simpson's dominance (D2), Simpson's evenness (E), and Berger- Parker dominance (BP). We calculated each of these indices for herbaceous plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, aboveground arthropods, belowground insect larvae, and P. lanceolata molecular and chemical diversity. Including these trait-based measures of diversity allowed us to test whether or not they behaved similarly to the better studied species diversity. We used path analysis to determine whether compound indices detected more relationships between diversities of different organisms and traits than more basic indices. In the path models, more paths were significant when using H', even though all models except that with E were equally reliable. This demonstrates that while common diversity indices may appear interchangeable in simple analyses, when considering complex interactions, the choice of index can profoundly alter the interpretation of results. Data mining in order to identify the index producing the most significant results should be avoided, but simultaneously considering analyses using multiple indices can provide greater insight into the interactions in a system.},

The blunt-nosed leopard lizard (Gambelia sila) is a federally endangered species that, despite protection, remains in extremely arid, hot areas and may be at risk of extirpation due to climate change. We collected data on the field-active body temperatures, preferred body temperatures and upper thermal tolerance of G. sila. We then described available thermal habitat using biophysical models, which allowed us to (i) describe patterns in lizard body temperatures, microhabitat temperatures and lizard microhabitat use; (ii) quantify the lizards' thermoregulatory accuracy; (iii) calculate the number of hours they are currently thermally restricted in microhabitat use; (iv) project how the number of restricted hours will change in the future as ambient temperatures rise; and (v) assess the importance of giant kangaroo rat burrows and shade-providing shrubs in the current and projected future thermal ecology of G. sila. Lizards maintained fairly consistent daytime body temperatures over the course of the active season, and use of burrows and shrubs increased as the season progressed and ambient temperatures rose. During the hottest part of the year, lizards shuttled among kangaroo rat burrows, shrubs, and open habitat to maintain body temperatures below their upper thermal tolerance, but, occasionally, higher than their preferred body temperature range. Lizards are restricted from staying in the open habitat for 75{\%} of daylight hours and are forced to seek refuge under shrubs or burrows to avoid surpassing their upper thermal threshold. After applying climatic projections of 1 and 2°C increases to 2018 ambient temperatures, G. sila will lose additional hours of activity time that could compound stressors faced by this population, potentially leading to extirpation.},

abstract = {Allocation to reproduction is often examined at the whole plant level from an allometric perspective; however, investment in reproduction is a hierarchical process which represents the integration of adjustments at different hierarchical levels. This essay review presents some key issues in reproductive allocation by examining problems of allocation at different hierarchical levels within plant. At the whole plant level, the application of 'Rensch's rule' to plants is discussed as a mechanism that might explain size differences in relation to gender in dioecious species. At branch level, the existence of vegetative branches may be explained by hypotheses on branch specialization and costs of reproduction. However, vegetative branches might also constitute an 'assurance' for reproduction in variable environments. At a lower hierarchical level, fruit abortion is a process widely observed in plants that impose limits to our capacity to estimate and develop general laws about reproductive allocation in plants. The question of whether fruit abortion can be used by the parent to produce a more homogeneous progeny that limits asymmetric competition among sibs is discussed. Finally, it seems that in some cases the allocation within seeds is in accordance with some predictions of kin selection theory. Most of these topics contain open questions that deserve further research.},

abstract = {Exercise-induced muscle damage is a well-described consequence of strenuous exercise, but its potential importance in the evolution of animal activity patterns is unknown. We used plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity as an indicator of muscle damage to investigate whether the high intensity, long-duration flights of two migratory shorebird species cause muscle damage that must be repaired during stopover. In two years of study, plasma CK activity was significantly higher in migrating western sandpipers (a non-synchronous, short-hop migrant), than in non-migrants. Similarly, in the bar-tailed godwit (a synchronous, long-jump migrant), plasma CK activity was highest immediately after arrival from a 4000-5000 km flight from West Africa to The Netherlands, and declined before departure for the arctic breeding areas. Late-arriving godwits had higher plasma CK activity than birds that had been at the stopover site longer. Juvenile western sandpipers making their first southward migration had higher plasma CK activity than adults. These results indicate that muscle damage occurs during migration, and that it is exacerbated in young, relatively untrained birds. However, the magnitude of the increases in plasma CK activity associated with migratory flight were relatively small, suggesting that the level of muscle damage is moderate. Migrants may avoid damage behaviourally, or have efficient biochemical and physiological defences against muscle injury.},

Although most nocturnally migrating birds end their migratory flight well before dawn, selection of habitat probably occurs during daylight hours. Possibly morning flights represent efforts to explore suitable habitats in which to rest and forage. Choice of habitat probably consists of a sequence of hierarchically ordered decisions that depend on different criteria. When migrants arrive they may settle in response to gross habitat features such as vegetation density, then search for resources based on more subtle habitat features or the behavior of other migrants. We used radio-telemetry to study the movement pattern of Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra) during stopover. Use of habitat and pattern of movement differed between fat and lean individuals. Lean birds were more active, displayed a pattern of movement more consistent with exploration, and visited more habitat types than did fatter birds.},

We examined the temporal and spatial distribution of reproductive shoots in Alnus hirsuta Turcz. var. sibirica (Fischer) C.K. Schn., assessed their direct and indirect costs of reproduction, and explained their distribution in the crown as the reproductive strategy of a current shoot population. The upper and lower limits to the lengths of current shoots for reproductive growth (flower formation) were 40 and 10 cm, respectively. Reproductive 1-year-old shoots produced fewer shoots in the following year than non-reproductive 1-year-old shoots. In current shoots longer than 40 cm, the increment of reproductive output in the following year by abandonment of reproduction surpassed the decrement of reproductive output in the current year by abandonment of reproduction. This may be one reason for the upper limit of reproductive shoot length. Thus, the current shoot population of A. hirsuta var. sibirica may be divided into three functionally specialized subpopulations: reproductive, maintenance, and exploratory. This specialization is considered to be a reproductive strategy to maximize their lifetime reproductive success.},

Mangrove Vireo pairs maintain year-long territories primarily in scrub, whereas individual White-eyed Vireos defend territories in a broad range of terrestrial habitats. The two species show a strong reciprocal distribution along a successional gradient from regenerating pasture and old field to mature dry forest. Within second growth scrub, White-eyed Vireos are primarily associated with patches of trees. Despite minor morphological differences typical of migrant-resident comparisons, we found no significant differences in the rates of different locomotory movement, in the relative proportion of attack type used, nor in foraging substrate. The major foraging differences were a lower reduced attack rate and greater use of fruit (primarily Bursera simaruba) in the White-eyed Vireo. Playback experiments failed to draw significant interspecific responses to song playback and elicited weak responses to conspecific and heterospecific chatter calls. Simultaneous call-in experiments and opportunistic observations failed to provide evidence of interspecific aggression. White-eyed Vireos, however, consistently chased Mangrove Vireos out of fruiting Bursera. We hypothesize that the extensive use of Bursera fruit allows White-eyed Vireos to over-winter in mature forest on the Yucatan Peninsula, a habitat that apparently cannot support breeding by vireos in the White-eyed Vireo complex.},

abstract = {Frugivory and seed dispersal are key processes for the maintenance of biodiversity. This is particularly true in the Neotropics, where most plant species depend on animals to disperse their seeds and most birds and mammals include fruits in their diets. We performed a continental-scale literature review to build a database of interactions between neotropical fruits and fruit-eating birds and mammals. Our objective was to evaluate the viability of combining literature data from different studies to describe the structure of highly diverse fruit–frugivore neotropical communities. We investigated sites that had been the focus of studies of at least four different avian and/or mammalian taxonomic orders and we included in our database only those conducted for at least a 6-month period in order to account for the seasonality in fruit availability. In spite of a large number of study sites investigated for frugivory (n = 156), we found a huge gap in the knowledge of community-wide fruit–frugivore interactions in the Neotropics, since most studies focused on single or a few species. Nevertheless, we were able to construct diverse plant–frugivore qualitative networks for 17 areas unevenly spread throughout the neotropical region. Using complex network analyses, we found that these networks were highly informative and non-randomly organized. Most networks were both significantly nested and modular, characteristics related to stability and resilience in biological systems. We concluded that it is possible to use merged data to build networks for sites of conservation interest. The main advantage of using this approach is to optimize resources, avoiding exhaustive, costly and time-consuming fieldwork when data is already available. Whilst bearing in mind the shortcomings of this methodology, these results can be used in studies aiming to understand the ecological processes structuring different communities in the neotropical region and to support conservation and restoration actions.},

abstract = {In the era of ongoing global change, it is highly important that restoration efforts lead to functioning, self-sustainable ecosystems that are resilient to disturbance and resistant to environmental changes. Therefore, it is necessary that restoration aims at achieving high genetic diversity of plant populations in addition to the recovery of characteristic species composition and diversity. Nevertheless, species- and gene-level biodiversity are rarely examined together in the context of restoration, although high genetic diversity of plant populations is a fundamental factor ensuring long-term success of restoration. Landscape-scale dispersal is the key process linked to the recovery of vegetation and maintaining both species and genetic diversity following restoration. In fragmented landscapes, dispersal of seeds and genetic material is often disrupted, leading to failure in spontaneous recovery of species richness as well as in establishment and maintenance of genetically diverse populations. Here, we review the linkages between landscape-scale dispersal of plants and the recovery of species richness and genetic diversity of plants during habitat restoration. We propose recommendations for restoration planners and practitioners to consider while aiming to restore self-sustainable ecosystems with high species- and gene-level biodiversity.},

Body size differences among frugivores are hypothesized to affect seed dispersal distances and consequently their effectiveness as dispersers. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effectiveness of two passerine birds, grackles (Onychognathus tristramii) and bulbuls (Pycnonotus xanthopygos), dispersing the desert shrub Ochradenus baccatus. Laboratory experiments, quantifying gut retention time and the effect on germination, were combined with field observations quantifying bird movements and fruit consumption rates. An empirically parameterized mechanistic model showed that the two dispersers switch roles as a function of spatial-scale: while most seeds within the local habitat were dispersed by bulbuls, the larger grackles were exclusively responsible for between-patches, long-distance dispersal. We suggest that distance-related differences are common and important to plant fitness, and thus should explicitly be considered in studies of disperser effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Patterns of association of three columnar cactus species with potential nurse plants and rocks were examined in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Arizona. Close spatial associates of cacti are often called “nurses” because they provide a less extreme microclimate for cactus seedlings, which improves survival rates. Of the three cacti, Carnegiea gigantea had the greatest frequency of association with nurse plants. Stenocereus thurberi, which is common on steep hillslopes where rocks and crevices offer numerous protected microsites for seedling establishment, was associated with nurse rocks more frequently than were the other two species. Lophocereus schottii showed the lowest frequency of association with nurses. In the Monument, L. schottii reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, which reduces the need of small cacti for protection from nurses. Species most frequently associated with the three cacti were among the dominant species where each cactus occurred except that sparsely foliated species were associated with cacti less frequently than expected. This pattern supports previous claims that structural characteristics are more important than species identification in providing cacti with enhanced chances for survival. It also suggests that at a landscape scale, population dynamics of columnar cacti are more closely linked to patterns of overall vegetation change than to population fluctuations of a particular species that acts as a nurse. {\textcopyright} 1989 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Plants alter environmental conditions enhancing the recruitment of other species. In spite of prior reviews of facilitation, the variability of its occurrence, mechanisms, and specificity across terrestrial ecosystems has not yet been assessed. In this article, we analyze facilitative mechanisms and the distribution of specific traits, such as nitrogen fixation and the presence of fleshy fruits, across ecosystems. A comprehensive database including 2,080 cases of facilitation among higher plants from 539 articles was analyzed with descriptive statistics for occurrences of positive interactions and underlying mechanisms in different terrestrial ecosystems. Positive interactions by plant-induced environmental changes are widespread in a range of ecosystems and not limited to conditions of chronic abiotic stress such as semiarid, alpine, and wetland ecosystems. The capability to act as nurse largely varied among different growth forms, and was observed more frequently for woody than for herbaceous plants. Nitrogen fixers occur much more frequently as nurse plants than as beneficiary plants in facilitation cases due to increasing soil fertility. As known for Mediterranean ecosystems, fleshy-fruited species appear more dependent on facilitative interactions than other plants, being more frequent among beneficiaries than among nurses. The pattern can be extended worldwide being consistent in wetland, temperate, and alpine ecosystems as well. Our description of the relationship between distribution, mechanisms, and specificity of facilitation in terrestrial ecosystems has implications for the understanding of plant community organization considering that plant nursing capacity is affected by their size, architecture, and life span. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {In contrast to many other biotic forces, such as competition and predation, the role played by habitat modification by plants and sessile animals in natural communities has not been given the experimental attention it deserves. To test the hypothesis that habitat modification by seaweed canopies can have direct positive effects on rocky intertidal communities, we quantified habitat amelioration by Ascophyllum nodosum canopies and its consequences on understory organisms in the Gulf of Maine, USA. At the upper and lower elevational borders of the algal canopy, we examined the recruitment, growth, and survivorship of common benthic organisms in canopy removal, canopy control, and shaded canopy removal plots intended to mimic canopy habitat modification. The algal canopy greatly reduced potential physical stresses, particularly at high tidal heights. Maximum daily rock temperatures were 5°-10°C lower and evaporative water loss was an order of magnitude less under the canopy than in canopy removal plots. The response of understory organisms to canopy removal, however, was species specific and somewhat idiosyncratic. Nonetheless, in general, at the high intertidal border of the canopy the recruitment, growth, and survival of understory organisms were enhanced by the canopy, whereas at the low intertidal border canopy effects were negative or neutral. Nearly half of the interactions we studied were positive in the high zone. In contrast to positive canopy effects on understory organism recruitment and growth at high tidal heights, consumer pressure was severe under the canopy, particularly at low tidal heights. Green Crab predation is likely responsible for limiting understory mussel densities, while grazing by the snail, Littorina littorea, keeps understory substrate clear of algal recruits. The amelioration of harsh physical conditions by algal canopies can have strong direct positive effects in high rocky intertidal communities by enhancing organism recruitment, growth, and survival. These canopy effects, however, may often be offset by increased consumer pressure at low tidal heights. These types of habitat modification effects are likely to be pervasive in many other terrestrial and marine communities exposed to harsh physical conditions.},

abstract = {Cooperation is widespread both within and between species, but are intraspecific and interspecific cooperation fundamentally similar or qualitatively different phenomena? This review evaluates this question, necessary for a general understanding of the evolution of cooperation. First, we outline three advantages of cooperation relative to noncooperation (acquisition of otherwise inaccessible goods and services, more efficient acquisition of resources, and buffering against variability), and predict when individuals should cooperate with a conspecific versus a heterospecific partner to obtain these advantages. Second, we highlight five axes along which heterospecific and conspecific partners may differ: relatedness and fitness feedbacks, competition and resource use, resource-generation abilities, relative evolutionary rates, and asymmetric strategy sets and outside options. Along all of these axes, certain asymmetries between partners are more common in, but not exclusive to, cooperation between species, especially complementary resource use and production. We conclude that cooperation within and between species share many fundamental qualities, and that differences between the two systems are explained by the various asymmetries between partners. Consideration of the parallels between intra- and interspecific cooperation facilitates application of well-studied topics in one system to the other, such as direct benefits within species and kin-selected cooperation between species, generating promising directions for future research.},

This paper examines the evidence for facilitation and clarifies our understanding in relation to the mechanisms and the spatial and temporal scales where they occur. Evidence for facilitation through stimulation of grass regrowth during the growing season appears stronger than that for increased resource access through removal of obstructing grass structures during the dormant season. Although facilitation may benefit the nutritional gains obtained by certain species in the short term, these benefits do not appear to be translated into the expected population consequences. We suggest this could be due to seasonal tradeoffs between facilitation and competition, as well as to restrictions on the spatial extent of trophic overlap.},

abstract = {Temporal environmental fluctuations, such as seasonality, exert strong controls on biodiversity. While the effects of seasonality are well known, the predictability of fluctuations across years may influence seasonality in ways that are less well understood. The ability of a habitat to support unique, non-nested assemblages of species at different times of the year should depend on both seasonality (occurrence of events at specific periods of the year) and predictability (the reliability of event recurrence) of characteristic ecological conditions. Drawing on tools from wavelet analysis and information theory, we developed a framework for quantifying both seasonality and predictability of habitats, and applied this using global long-term rainfall data. Our analysis predicted that temporal beta diversity should be maximized in highly predictable and highly seasonal climates, and that low degrees of seasonality, predictability, or both would lower diversity in characteristic ways. Using stream invertebrate communities as a case study, we demonstrated that temporal species diversity, as exhibited by community turnover, was determined by a balance between temporal environmental variability (seasonality) and the reliability of this variability (predictability). Communities in highly seasonal mediterranean environments exhibited strong oscillations in community structure, with turnover from one unique community type to another across seasons, whereas communities in aseasonal New Zealand environments fluctuated randomly. Understanding the influence of seasonal and other temporal scales of environmental oscillations on diversity is not complete without a clear understanding of their predictability, and our framework provides tools for examining these trends at a variety of temporal scales, seasonal and beyond. Given the uncertainty of future climates, seasonality and predictability are critical considerations for both basic science and management of ecosystems (e.g., dam operations, bioassessment) spanning gradients of climatic variability.},

Using three scales of resolution, we examine the importance of a long-lived desert tree, ironwood (Olneya tesota), in structuring plant communities and promoting biological diversity in the Sonoran Desert. We examined the positive effects of Olneya canopies of different sizes on plant communities in mesic and xeric habitats throughout the central Gulf Coast subregion of Sonora, Mexico. In xeric sites, Olneya canopies had strong positive effects on plant richness and abundance, and small positive effects on the size of plants, underscoring the role of facilitation in extreme environments. In mesic sites, Olneya canopies had very little effect on perennials and a negative effect on ephemeral richness, suggesting predominantly competitive effects in this less stressful environment. Overall, Olneya canopies increased biological diversity where abiotic stress was high, but did not increase diversity in more mesic areas. Thus Olneya canopies caused consistent shifts in plant-community structure among xeric and mesic sites, but not when these landscapes were combined. Benefactor size also mediated positive interactions, with larger Olneya canopies supporting larger perennials in both xeric and mesic sites. Thus stress gradients and benefactor size both influenced the balance of facilitative and competitive effects under nurse-plant canopies, and the spatial scale at which facilitative effects shape community structure.},

abstract = {Facilitation between species is thought to be a key mechanism by which biodiversity affects the rates of resource use that govern the efficiency and productivity of ecosystems1-4; however, there is no direct empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. Here we show that increasing the species diversity of a functional group of aquatic organisms induces facilitative interactions, leading to non-additive changes in resource consumption. We increased the richness and evenness of suspension-feeding caddisfly larvae (Insecta, Trichoptera) in stream mesocosms and found that the increased topographical complexity of the benthic habitat alters patterns of near-bed flow such that the feeding success of individuals is enhanced. Species diversity reduces 'current shading' (that is, the deceleration of flow from upstream to downstream neighbours), allowing diverse assemblages to capture a greater fraction of suspended resources than is caught by any species monoculture. The fundamental nature of this form of hydrodynamic facilitation suggests that it is broadly applicable to freshwater and marine habitats; in addition, it has several analogues in terrestrial ecosystems where fluxes of energy and matter can be influenced by biophysical complexity3,5,6. Thus, changes in species diversity may alter the probability of positive species interactions, resulting in disproportionately large changes in the functioning of ecosystems.},

abstract = {1. While the relationship between facilitation and competition has been explored extensively in recent years, there is also a natural link between facilitation and mutualism, as both are interspecific interactions that confer benefits. Yet, the relationship between these two interactions has been minimally explored. 2. Here, I explore parallels and differences between mutualism and facilitation. Five focal areas organize current research on mutualism evolution: trait evolution; the continuum from specialization to generalization; the evolutionary origins and maintenance of the interaction; co-evolution of partners; and the prevalence and implications of cheating. These foci are also helpful for investigating how facilitation evolves, a much less explored issue. 3. Testable hypotheses regarding the evolution of facilitation include the following: selection should be stronger on traits of facilitated species than on traits of facilitators; facilitative interactions with mutualistic (++) and commensal (+0) outcomes should exhibit greater evolutionary stability than those with antagonistic (+-) outcomes; co-evolution should be possible in mutualistic and antagonistic facilitation only; when co-evolution occurs, it should produce a geographic mosaic of interaction outcomes; and antagonistic facilitation could lead to selection on facilitators to either escape or to tolerate the neighbours that benefit from them. 4.Synthesis. Three gaps in our knowledge currently impede progress on evolutionary questions surrounding facilitation. First, reciprocal effects are rarely investigated; facilitation might evolve like mutualism, commensalism or antagonism, depending on effects on the facilitator species. Secondly, the genetics of relevant traits are not yet well explored; the traits themselves are better known for facilitator species than for the facilitated, which are more likely to evolve in the context of the interaction. Finally, the fitness costs and benefits associated with facilitation have rarely been measured. Filling these gaps should permit rapid progress in understanding how facilitation arises, persists and evolves. {\textcopyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Mutualisms arc of central importance in biological systems. Despite growing attention in recent years, however, few conceptual themes have yet to be identified that span mutualisms differing in natural history. Here I examine the idea that the ecology and evolution of mutualisms are shaped by diverse costs, not only by the benefits they confer. This concept helps link mutualism to antagonisms such as herbivory, pr{\'{e}}dation, and parasitism, interactions defined largely by the existence of costs. I first briefly review the range of costs associated with mutualisms, then describe how one cost, the consumption of seeds by pollinator offspring, was quantified for one fig/pollinator mutualism. I compare this cost to published values for other fig/pollinator mutualisms and for other kinds of pollinating seed parasite mutualisms, notably the yucca/yucca moth interaction. I then discuss four issues that fundamentally complicate comparative studies of the cost of mutualism:. problems of knowing how to measure the magnitude of any one cost accurately; problems associated with using average estimates in the absence of data on sources of variation; complications arising from the complex correlates of costs, such as functional linkages between costs and benefits; and problems that arise from considering the cost of mutualism as a unilateral issue in what is fundamentally a reciprocal interaction. The rich diversity of as-yet unaddressed questions surrounding the costs of mutualism may best be investigated via detailed studies of individual interactions.},

abstract = {Documenting variation in thermoregulatory patterns across phylogenetically and geographically diverse taxa is key to understanding the evolution of endothermy and heterothermy in birds and mammals. We recorded body temperature (Tb) in free-ranging desert hedgehogs (Paraechinus aethiopicus) across three seasons in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. Modal Tb 's (35°– 36.5°C) were slightly below normal for mammals but still warmer than those of other hedgehogs. The single maximum Tb recorded was 39.2°C, which is cooler than maximum Tb 's recorded in most desert mammals. Desert hedgehogs commonly used torpor during winter and spring but never during summer. Torpor bouts occurred frequently but irregularly, and most lasted less than 24 h. Unlike daily heterotherms, desert hedgehogs did occasionally remain torpid for more than 24 h, including one bout of 101 h. Body temperatures during torpor were often within 2°–3°C of ambient temperature; however, we never recorded repeated bouts of long, predictable torpor punctuated by brief arousal periods similar to those common among seasonal hibernators. Thus, desert hedgehogs can be included on the ever-growing list of species that display torpor patterns intermediate to traditionally defined hibernators and daily heterotherms. Extant hedgehogs are a recent radiation within an ancient family, and the intermediate thermoregulatory pattern displayed by desert hedgehogs is unlike the deeper and more regular torpor seen in other hedgehogs, suggesting that this may be a derived—as opposed to ancestral—trait in this subfamily. We suggest that this family (Erinaceidae) and order (Eulipotyphla) may be important for understanding the evolution of thermoregulatory patterns among Laurasiatheria and mammals in general.},

abstract = {Question: Positive interactions are predicted to be common in communities developing under high physical stress or high herbivory pressure due to neighbour amelioration of limiting physical and consumer stresses, respectively. However, when both stress sources meet in the same community, the relative importance of the two facilitation mechanisms is poorly understood. We ask: What is the relative importance of abiotic vs. biotic mechanisms of facilitation of tree saplings by shrubs in Mediterranean mountain forests? Location: Sierra Nevada, SE Spain (1800-1850 m a.s.l.) Methods: Saplings of four tree taxa (Acer opalus ssp. granatense, Quercus ilex, Pinus nigra ssp. salzmanii and P. sylvestris var. nevadensis) were planted following a 2 x 2 factorial design: two levels of herbivory (control and ungulate exclusion) and two microhabitats (under shrubs and in open areas). Sapling survival and growth were monitored for five years. Results: Shrubs had positive effects on sapling survival both in control and ungulate excluded plots. This effect was species-specific, with shrubs increasing the survival of Acer opalus and Quercus ilex three and twofold, respectively, but having a minor effect on the Pinus species. Herbivory damage was also species-specific, being much higher for Acer opalus than for any other species. Shrubs did not protect saplings of any species against ungulates. Thus, all Acer saplings (the most damaged species) suffered herbivory outside the exclosures, which largely reduced sapling height. Conclusions: Protection from abiotic stress (summer drought and winter frost) was much more relevant than protection from biotic stress (herbivory). However, we propose that the final balance between the two mechanisms can be expected to vary strongly between sites, depending on the relative magnitude of the different sources of stress and the intrinsic traits (e.g. palatability) of the species interacting. {\textcopyright} IAVS; Opulus Press.},

abstract = {Spatial genetic structure (SGS) of plants results from the nonrandom distribution of related individuals. SGS provides information on gene flow and spatial patterns of genetic diversity within populations. Seed dispersal creates the spatial template for plant distribution. Thus, in zoochorous plants, dispersal mode and disperser behaviour might have a strong impact on SGS. However, many studies only report the taxonomic group of seed dispersers, without further details. The recent increase in studies on SGS provides the opportunity to review findings and test for the influence of dispersal mode, taxonomic affiliation of dispersers and their behaviour. We compared the proportions of studies with SGS among groups and tested for differences in strength of SGS using Sp statistics. The presence of SGS differed among taxonomic groups, with reduced presence in plants dispersed by birds. Strength of SGS was instead significantly influenced by the behaviour of seed dispersal vectors, with higher SGS in plant species dispersed by animals with behavioural traits that result in short seed dispersal distances. We observed high variance in the strength of SGS in plants dispersed by animals that actively or passively accumulate seeds. Additionally, we found SGS was also affected by pollination and marker type used. Our study highlights the importance of vector behaviour on SGS even in the presence of variance created by other factors. Thus, more detailed information on the behaviour of seed dispersers would contribute to better understand which factors shape the spatial scale of gene flow in animal-dispersed plant species.},

These patches occur where rain has recently fallen, where there has been growth and seeding of grasses, and where invertebrates are locally abundant. They are also attractive to domestic livestock which may constitute a threat to successful breeding by the larks. Since rainfall in the Nama-Karoo is unpredictable in time and space on a regional scale, it is difficult a priori to select protected areas for such nomadic birds. As a first approach, we present a spatio-temporal model for estimating the survival of flocks in relation to different configurations of protected areas. The results show that neither one large protected area nor a high number of small protected areas provide the optimal solution. This is due to the impact of various spatial effects which affect the probability of a flock finding a suitable breeding area. These effects are identified and discussed. Furthermore, we are able to reproduce and explain the present spatial abundance of the larks on a regional scale with our model. The model is intended to complement and define the field studies needed to determine practical parameters more precisely.},

Some authors have suggested the same pollination pattern for Agave genus, and even when recent meta-analysis does not find such pattern, they have suggested this could be due to the lack of descriptive studies of pollination for this genus. Hypothesis: According to the chiropterophily syndrome of its flowers, the most efficient pollinator of Agave horrida will be nectarivorous bats leading to a pollination system with a specialist tendency in this agave species. Studied species: Agave horrida and floral visitors. Study site and years of study: Lava field of the Chichinautzin mountain range, in Morelos State in Central Mexico in 2005. Methods: we studied the floral biology of A. horrida, its floral offer (density of flowers in a given area), visitor rate, and visitor abundance, and conducted exclusion experiments for diurnal and nocturnal visitors. Results: A. horrida has protandric flowers with chiropterophilous characteristics (larger nectar production at night and nocturnal anther dehiscence and stigma receptivity). Nectarivorous bats were the most frequent flower visitors and the guild that most frequently presented pollen on their bodies. Pollinator exclusion experiments show that both birds and bats can successfully pollinate A. horrida. Nevertheless, the predictability and abundance of the nectarivorous bat Leptonycteris nivalis, along with the greater fruit and seed production than birds, makes it the most efficient pollinator. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis of a specialized pollination system towards nectarivorous bats in agaves in central Mexico.},

Abstract Population numbers of many bird species associated with early-successional or disturbance-dependent habitat types are declining. We used an information–theoretic approach to evaluate hypotheses concerning factors affecting breeding bird densities in different early-successional habitat types. We studied shrubland bird communities in 3-to 5-year-old regenerating forest (n ¼ 3), glade (n ¼ 3), and forest–pasture edge (n ¼ 3) habitat types in the predominantly forested Missouri Ozarks in 1997–1999. We monitored 8 bird species using spot mapping and total mapping techniques, searched for and monitored nests, and measured vegetation structure within nested circular plots. In evaluating breeding densities in these habitat types, we compared support for a global model with year, habitat type, and a habitat type 3 year interaction to several reduced models and a null model with only an intercept, and we used model-averaged coefficients to evaluate effect size. We found support for the effects of habitat type on breeding densities of prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor) and yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens); the effects of habitat type and year on densities of blue-winged warbler (Vermivora pinus), eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), and field sparrow (Spizella pusilla); the effect of year on densities of indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) and northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis); and no effects on densities of white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus). The effect size of habitat type on breeding densities varied among species and indicated important species-specific differences in habitat use. Most shrubland bird species used both glades and regenerating forests more than forest– pasture edge sites, and breeding densities of some species were higher in regenerating forests than in glades. For some species, patterns in reproductive success (reported as interval nest success) mirrored observed patterns in breeding densities. However, substantial variation existed among species with respect to patterns in habitat use and nest success. Conservation planning for the persistence of birds requiring early-successional habitat types should consider the ephemeral nature of these areas and the potential contribution from young, regenerating forest.},

abstract = {Background and Aims Facilitation among plants in water-limited environments (i.e. where evapotranspiration overcomes the availability of water during the growing season) has been considered a local adaptation to water and light conditions. Among cacti, early life-history stages can benefit from the facilitative effects of nurse plants that reduce solar radiation and water stress. However, whether light condition itself acts as an agent of selection through facilitation remains untested. The aim of this study was to determine (1) whether light conditions affect seedling recruitment, (2) whether the positive effect of shade on seedling recruitment is more intense under more stressful conditions and (3) whether shade condition (facilitation) reduces the magnitude of local adaptation on seedling recruitment relative to full sunlight conditions. Methods A reciprocal transplant experiment, coupled with the artificial manipulation of sun/shade conditions, was performed to test for the effects of local adaptation on germination, seedling survival and growth, using two demes of the columnar cactus Pilosocereus leucocephalus, representing different intensities of stressful conditions. Key Results Full sunlight conditions reduced recruitment success and supported the expectation of lower recruitment in more stressful environments. Significant local adaptation was mainly detected under full sunlight conditions, indicating that this environmental factor acts as an agent of selection at both sites. Conclusions The results supported the expectation that the magnitude of local adaptation, driven by the effects of facilitative nurse plants, is less intense under reduced stressful conditions. This study is the first to demonstrate that sun/shade conditions act as a selective agent accounting for local adaptation in water-limited environments, and that facilitation provided by nurse plants in these environments can attenuate the patterns of local adaptation among plants benefiting from the nurse effect. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.},

abstract = {1 Theoretical models have predicted that the relative importance of facilitation and competition will vary inversely across gradients of abiotic stress, with facilitation being the dominant interaction under high abiotic stress conditions. A critical reappraisal of current theoretical models is needed because experimental studies both support and refute their predictions. 2 A quantitative meta-analysis of field and common garden studies evaluating the effect of abiotic stress (low vs. high) on the net outcome of plant-plant interactions in arid and semi-arid environments was performed to evaluate the degree of empirical support for these models. We created four separate data sets corresponding to the categories of response variables commonly used to measure plant performance (survival, density, growth and fecundity). 3 The analyses showed that both the selection of the estimator of plant performance and the experimental approach followed have a strong influence on both the net outcome of plant-plant interactions and the effect of abiotic stress on such outcome. The effect of neighbours on the survival and growth of target plants was not significant at either stress level, but that on the density and fecundity of target plants was positive (facilitation) and negative (competition) at the low and high abiotic stress level, respectively. Density data showed that the net effect of neighbours was positive and negative at low and high abiotic stress levels, respectively, whereas other estimators suggested that the net effect of neighbours did not differ with stress level. None of our meta-analyses indicated that the magnitude of the net effect provided by neighbours, whether positive or negative, was higher under high abiotic stress conditions, and facilitation does not therefore appear to increase in importance with abiotic stress. 4 As the predictions of current theoretical models regarding the relationship between the net outcome of a plant-plant interaction and abiotic stress do not hold in arid and semi-arid environments, different models are needed. These should consider different sources of abiotic stress separately, and should be valid for performance measurements, such as survival, that integrate plant responses over time. The incorporation of these features into theoretical models will undoubtedly improve their predictive capabilities. {\textcopyright} 2005 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {1 Using meta-analysis, b1Maestre et al. (2005, Journal of Ecology, 93, 748-757) recently rejected the predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis for arid and semi-arid environments in entirety. It was concluded that neither positive nor negative effects of neighbours increased with abiotic stress and that different theoretical models are now needed. 2 In light of this sweeping conclusion, we re-examined the analytical approach and explored the general synthetic power of meta-analysis. 3 Detailed statistical re-analyses demonstrated that some of the meta-analyses of Maestre et al. were robust. However, more rigorous data selection criteria, changing gradient lengths between studies and covariance in response effects did not support their original conclusions. Additionally, application of more rigorous data selection criteria did allow us to detect a significant and consistent positive effect of neighbours, which suggests that facilitation is important at many points along stress gradients. 4 Careful evaluation of the studies used by Maestre et al. also revealed serious limitations. Many studies included in the meta-analyses were not conducted along stress gradients, did not identify a stress gradient within the study, focused on invasive species or were not peer reviewed. Most importantly, however, gradient lengths were not quantified and appeared to differ dramatically among studies. This crucial source of variation was not accounted for statistically nor in the interpretations. 5 Meta-analyses are useful tools for synthesis and description but are inherently limited by the appropriateness of the data selected. Unfortunately, in this particular instance, the data available to and selected by Maestre et al. did not adequately test the stress-gradient hypothesis and cannot thus reject its value for understanding the organization of plant communities in arid systems. 6 The ecological implication of our synthesis is that meta-analytical summary statistics may not always tell the whole story. Alternative interpretations of differences in effect sizes (or lack thereof) are possible because studies will vary in their ability to test specific predictions of a hypothesis, and furthermore, a certain level of judgement is required to infer the relative importance of certain ideas to synthetic progress within a discipline. {\textcopyright} 2005 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Since many arid ecosystems are overstocked with domestic herbivores, biotic stress could have a stronger influence in modulating the balance of species interactions than expected from the stress gradient hypothesis (SGH). Here we tested a priori predictions about the effect of grazing on species interactions and fine scale spatial structure of grasses in water-limited ecosystems. We used detailed vegetation mapping and spatial analysis, and performed a field experiment where the direct and indirect components of positive interactions were disentangled to provide evidence of links between process and pattern. We found associational resistance (biotic refuge) to be the dominant process in grazing situations, while competition, instead of direct facilitation, seemed to govern grass spatial patterns when herbivore pressure was relaxed. These results suggest that facilitation between grasses in arid communities may be related to herbivory rather than nurse plant effects. Associational resistance tends to have the strongest effect on spatial aggregation of species at intermediate grazing pressure. Results suggest that contrary to SGH, this physical clustering of species decreased when grazing pressure reached their maximum levels. Positive associations remained significant only when palatability differences between neighbours is large, suggesting that managing stocking rate is a key factor determining the persistence of herbivory refuges. These refuges are potential foci to initiate population recovery of high quality forage species in arid degraded areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.},

abstract = {Reliable plans for desert bird conservation will depend on accurate prediction of habitat change effects on their distribution and abundance patterns. Predictive models can help highlight relationships between human-related and other environmental variables and the presence of desert bird species. Presence/absence of 30 desert bird species of Baja California peninsula was modelled on the basis of explanatory variables taken from the field, maps, and digital imagery. Generalized linear models were fit to each bird species using both variables representing human activity and other environmental factors as predictors that might influence distribution. Probability of species presence was used as a habitat suitability index to evaluate the effect of human activity when the model contained a significant human activity variable. No differences were found in bird species richness between natural sites and those transformed by agriculture or urbanization. Of 59 bird species recorded in surveys, 34{\%} were positively or negatively associated with human-transformed habitats. Fourteen species seem to benefit from transformation of natural vegetation by agriculture or urbanization, while six were negatively affected. Sensitivity analyses of final models indicated all were robust. Results suggest that the occurrence of a large percentage of bird species inhabiting scrub habitats is sensitive to human habitat transformation. This finding has important conservation implications at regional scale as fragmentation and conversion of desert ecosystems into agricultural and urban areas affect the distribution of species that are highly selective for scrub habitat. Land use and anthropogenic activities seem to change ecological patterns at large spatial scales, but other factors could drive species richness distribution too (i.e. individual species response, species-energy relationships). The spatial modelling approach at regional scale used in this study can be useful for designing natural resource management plans in the Sonoran desert scrub. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author.},

abstract = {Large areas of the southern California desert ecosystem have been negatively affected by off-highway vehicle use, overgrazing by domestic livestock, agriculture, urbanization, construction of roads and utility corridors, air pollution, military training exercises, and other activities. Secondary contributions to degradation include the proliferation of exotic plant species and a higher frequency of an- thropogenic fire. Effects of these impacts include alteration or destruction of macro- and micro- vegetation elements, establishment of annual plant communities dominated by exotic species, destruction of soil stabilizers, soil compaction, and increased erosion. Published estimates of recovery time are based on return to predisturbance levels of biomass, cover, density, community structure, or soil characteristics. Natural recovery rates depend on the nature and severity of the impact but are generally very slow. Recovery to predisturbance plant cover and biomass may take 50-300 years, while complete ecosystem recovery may require over 3000 years. Restorative intervention can be used to enhance the success and rate of recovery, but the costs are high and the probability for long-term success is low to moderate. Given the sensitivity of desert habitats to disturbance and the slow rate of natural recovery, the best management option is to limit the extent and intensity of impacts as much as possible.},

This problem is encountered in tropical mixed forests, in uneven-aged and even-aged forests of the Northern Hemisphere, and in intensively managed timber plantations. Optimizing the temporal spatial pattern of forest harvest is a combinatorial problem which can be solved using the "Model I". It is difficult to imagine forest management without the support of an integrated database system. Equally important are flexible growth and yield models. These are generally available for even-aged stands, but are not readily available for uneven-aged mixed forests.},

abstract = {Nomadic birds move around the landscape in complex, irregular patterns, making it difficult for conservation managers and planners to decide where and how to act to mitigate threatening processes. Because of this uncertainty, nomadic species are poorly represented in protected areas in Australia. We outline approaches to discover nomadic species distributions, their dynamics and their consequent vulnerability to extinction. Using citizen science initiatives like eBird Australia and the BirdLife Australia Atlas, combined with new ways of applying species distribution modelling that take into account temporal patterns of movement driven by weather and productivity, we demonstrate how to map and predict the key sites for conservation action for nomadic species. We explore recent advancements in decision-support tools to incorporate species movements into systematic conservation planning, and highlight challenges in traditional approaches for protected area designation for conserving nomads. Due to the spatio-temporal dynamism of nomadic species distributions, the projected costs of managing nomads across Australia using traditional, static, protected areas are prohibitive. Landholders, including graziers and indigenous landholders, will play a key role in safeguarding these species on pastoral lands into the future, and future conservation efforts should be focussed on these stakeholders, through a combination of community engagement, market-based incentives (such as biodiversity farming or payments for artificial water source and ephemeral wetland management), cross-boundary and cross-agency collaboration policies, and new legislative instruments. Accounting for the movements of nomadic species and incorporating new approaches to integrated land management will help design conservation solutions that are effective, cost-efficient, and robust to uncertainty in this rapidly changing world.},

abstract = {Proper vaccination with validated companion differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) tests using a vaccine containing a heterologous neuraminidase to the field virus can be effective to control avian influenza (AI). However, indirect immunofluorescent assay, the only field validated DIVA test, has limitations to be set up as high throughput screening test and the assay requires subjective interpretation of the results. To apply the DIVA strategy to the Korean H9N2 low pathogenic AI (LPAI) vaccine program and overcome these limitations, we generated a reassortant H9N8 virus (rgH9N8) vaccine using plasmid-based reverse genetics and developed a novel N2-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (N2-ELISA). The rgH9N8 vaccine showed adequate immunogenicity and protection, and the optimized N2-ELISA showed that the sensitivity was 97.0{\%} and specificity was 96.4{\%} compared with a hemagglutination inhibition test. In vaccination-challenge experiments in specific pathogen-free chickens, the sera of chickens vaccinated with rgH9N8 vaccine and uninfected were negative by the N2-ELISA (S/P ≤ 0.4), whereas infected sera with H9N2 were positive (S/P {\textgreater} 0.4). These results suggest that the rgH9N8 vaccine and the companion DIVA test, N2-ELISA, allow the utilization of the DIVA strategy for the control of H9N2 LPAI infections in Korea. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Lima2009,
abstract = {A growing body of work suggests that breeding birds have a significant capacity to assess and respond, over ecological time, to changes in the risk of predation to both themselves and their eggs or nestlings. This review investigates the nature of this flexibility in the face of predation from both behavioural and reproductive perspectives, and also explores several directions for future research. Most available work addresses different aspects of nest predation. A substantial change in breeding location is perhaps the best documented response to nest predation, but such changes are not always observed and not necessarily the best strategy. Changes in nesting microhabitat (to more concealed locations) following predation are known to occur. Surprisingly little work addresses the proactive avoidance of areas with many nest predators, but such avoidance is probably widespread. Individual birds could conceivably adopt anti-predator strategies based on the nest predators actually present in an area, but such effects have yet to be demonstrated. In fact, the ways in which birds assess the risk of nest predation is unclear. Nest defence in birds has historically received much attention, but little is known about how it interacts with other aspects of decision-making by parents. Other studies concentrate on predation risk to adults. Some findings suggest that risk to adults themselves influences territory location, especially relative to raptor nests. An almost completely unexplored area concerns the sorts of social protection from predators that might exist during the breeding season. Flocking typical of the non-breeding season appears unusual while breeding, but a mated pair may sometimes act as a "flock of two". Opportunistic heterospecific sociality may exist, with heterospecific protector species associations more prevalent than currently appreciated. The dynamics of singing during the breeding season may also respond to variation in predation risk, but empirical research on this subject is limited. Furthermore, a few theoretical and empirical studies suggest that changes in predation risk also influence the behaviour of lekking males. The major influence of predators on avian life histories is undoubtedly expressed at a broad phylogenetic scale, but several studies hint at much flexibility on an ecological time scale. Some species may forgo breeding completely if the risk of nest predation is too high, and a few studies document smaller clutch sizes in response to an increase in nest predation. Recent evidence suggests that a female may produce smaller eggs rather than smaller clutches following an increase in nest predation risk. Such an increase may also influence decisions about intraspecific brood parasitism. There are no clear examples of changes in clutch/egg size with changes in risk experienced by adults, but parental responses to predators have clear consequences for offspring fitness. Changes in risk to adults may also influence body mass changes across the breeding season, although research here is sparse. The topics highlighted herein are all in need more empirical attention, and more experimental field work whenever feasible. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

abstract = {Facilitation studies focus primarily on plants often neglecting the extended effects that cascade through ecological networks. Plants interact with other organisms through consumptive effects and a myriad of non-trophic effects such as habitat amelioration or pollination. Shrubs are a dominant benefactor species frequent in plant-facilitation studies but can also have direct and indirect interactions with animals. Herein, we use a systematic review to address the following two objectives: (i) to propose a conceptual framework that explores these interactions including the functional roles of the interacting species, and (ii) to quantitatively summarize the current state of this field examining effects beyond plant–plant interactions. To date, a relatively limited number of studies have examined the importance of coupled benefactor-subordinate plant positive interactions with animals (79 studies in total). From this set of studies, 36 studies documented positive plant interactions generating a total of 53 independent instances of either shrub–plant–animal or shrub–animal–plant interactions. These interaction pathways were evenly split between direct (49{\%}) and indirect (51{\%}) interactions of shrubs with animals. Hypotheses frequently tested included seed trapping, herbivore protection, magnet pollination and facilitation-mediated secondary seed dispersal. The most common functional role of shrubs was protection from herbivory, and the most common animal role associated with plant-facilitation complexes was that of a consumer. None of these studies explored bidirectional plant–animal interactions, used a network approach to describe the interaction sets, nor contrasted interaction strengths. Multitrophic, integrated sets of experiments incorporating plant facilitation into community dynamics are thus critical in advancing management of high-stress ecosystems wherein positive interactions are commonly reported.},

abstract = {While it is widely acknowledged that nurse-plants facilitate the establishment of seedlings in drylands, there are several anecdotal reports on associations between cacti and rocks. We assessed the preference for rocks or shrubs from the spatial distribution of eight cactus species (Mammillaria spp.). We experimentally assessed if distribution results from facilitation evaluating the survival of Mammillaria pectinifera seedlings growing next to rocks or under nylon sunblockers that simulated shrub shading. We found that more than half of the species avoided shrubs, while 50{\%} of them were positively associated with rocks. Longevity and growth were highest for seedlings placed next to stones, so it may be concluded that the observed association is due to differential survival and not to other processes such as non-random seed dispersal. It is broadly accepted that the association between cacti and shrubs is mainly due to shading, however it may also represent a cost for the seedling in terms of photosynthetically active radiation. Rocks may provide a fresh and moist environment without reducing sunlight. Our results are relevant for conservation and reintroduction programs. It is important to continue the research on stress amelioration in drylands and to consider other kinds of nurse objects besides plant canopies. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1. Demographic data from both breeding and non-breeding periods are needed to manage populations of migratory birds, many of which are declining in abundance and are of conservation concern. Although habitat associations, and to a lesser extent, reproductive biology, are known for many migratory species, few studies have measured survival rates of these birds at different parts of their annual cycle. 2. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models and Akaike's information criterion model selection were used to investigate seasonal variation in survival of a Nearctic - Neotropical migrant songbird, the black-throated blue warbler, Dendroica caerulescens. Seasonal and annual survival were estimated from resightings of colour-ringed individuals on breeding grounds in New Hampshire, USA from 1986 to 2000 and on winter quarters in Jamaica, West Indies from 1986 to 1999. Warblers were studied each year during the May-August breeding period in New Hampshire and during the October-March overwinter period in Jamaica. 3. In New Hampshire, males had higher annual survival (0.51 ± 0.03) and recapture probabilities (0.93 ± 0.03) than did females (survival: 0.40 ± 0.04; recapture: 0.87 ± 0.06). In Jamaica, annual survival (0.43 ± 0.03) and recapture (0.95 ± 0.04) probabilities did not differ between sexes. Annual survival and recapture probabilities of young birds (i.e. yearlings in New Hampshire and hatch-year birds in Jamaica) did not differ from adults, indicating that from the time hatch-year individuals acquire territories on winter quarters in mid-October, they survive as well as adults within the same habitat. 4. Monthly survival probabilities during the summer (May-August) and winter (October-March) stationary periods were high: 1.0 for males in New Hampshire, and 0.99 ± 0.01 for males in Jamaica and for females in both locations. 5. These annual and seasonal survival estimates were used to calculate warbler survival for the migratory periods. Monthly survival probability during migration ranged from 0.77 to 0.81 ± 0.02. Thus, apparent mortality rates were at least 15 times higher during migration compared to that in the stationary periods, and more than 85{\%} of apparent annual mortality of D. caerulescens occurred during migration. 6. Additional data from multiple species, especially measures of habitat-specific demography and dispersal, will improve our understanding of the relative impacts of the breeding, migratory, and winter periods on population dynamics of migratory birds and thus enhance future conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Research on plant–animal interactions has been focused on direct consumer interactions (i.e. plants as resources), but non-trophic interactions including providing shelter or interference with movement can also affect the fine-scale distribution of animals. In particular, non-trophic interactions that are positive could support threatened animal populations. Positive interactions have been used in the restoration of plant communities, but have not yet been extended to the management of animal habitat. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that non-trophic interactions influence the occurrence of an endangered lizard species in an arid shrub-annual system. At a location known to have a population of blunt-nosed leopard lizards (Gambelia sila), we geotagged 700 shrubs, measured shrub morphometric traits, collected biomass samples, and surveyed for lizard presence using scat detection dogs over two years. Relative to 2014, in 2013 plant productivity was high and lizard scats were found more frequently in areas with low invasive grass cover (i.e. residual dry matter, RDM). In 2014, plant productivity was low because of an extreme drought year, and lizard scats were more frequently observed under shrub canopies, particularly those with relatively dense cover. These findings support the novel theory that positive non-trophic interactions are a critical form of plant–animal interactions in addition to consumption. Dominant shrubs can act as a foundation species by functioning as a basal node in structuring both plant and animal communities through a network of interactions. Managing dominant plants, in addition to habitat, is therefore important for conserving animal species in arid ecosystems.},

abstract = {We conducted a neighbor removal experiment in natural alpine plant communities of the southwestern Alps to test for the relative importance of competitive and facilitative interactions along elevational and topographical gradients. The experimental sites were chosen to encompass most of the floristic diversity observed along gradients of elevation and topography, which are the two main ecological gradients associated with alpine plant communities in the western Alps. The effects of neighbor removal on the survival, aboveground biomass, and reproduction of five target species were tested at each of six experimental sites. Using biomass data, we calculated relative competitive index (RCI) and log response ratio (LRR) as measures of interaction strength and direction. We found highly significant shifts from strong competitive effects in low and sheltered sites to strong facilitative responses in high and exposed sites. When experimental results were integrated with gradient analyses, we found that the responses of particular alpine plant species to neighbor removal generally depended on the species' position on elevational and topographical gradients. When neighbors were removed from around target species at experimental sites that were lower in elevation than the distributional mean of the target species, biomass generally increased. When neighbors were removed from around target species at experimental sites that were higher in elevation than the distributional mean of the target species, biomass decreased. In other words, facilitation appeared to allow species from lower elevations to move up the gradient, but competition at low elevations appeared to restrict species from higher elevations from moving down the gradient. In high and exposed sites, experimental evidence for facilitation was coupled to small-scale spatial associations among species, but spatial disassociation was not coupled to experimental evidence for competition at any sites. We conclude that the distribution and abundance of many species in high-elevation communities of the western Alps appears to be enhanced by neighbors, and that species continua commonly observed along environmental gradients are the result of both negative and positive plant interactions.},

abstract = {When the day/night air temperatures were raised from 10°C/10°C to 30°C/30°C, the optimal tempearture for nocturnal CO2 uptake by six species of cacti and three species of agave shifted from an average of 12°C to an average of 20°C. The maximum rate of CO2 uptake was higher for Agave americana at the higher ambient temperature, lower for A. deserti, and much lower for A. utahensis, consistent with the relative mean temperatures of their native habitats. For the cactus Coryphantha vivipara, which had the greatest temperature shift observed (13°C), the halftime was 8 days for the upward shift and 4 days for the downward shift. The halftimes for the comparable shifts averaged 1.6 days for three other species of cacti and less than 1 day for two agave species. The shifts in the optimal temperature for nocturnal CO2 uptake were in response to changes in nighttime temperature, at least for C. vivipara, and reflected temperature responses of both the stomates and the chlorenchyma.

abstract = {The effects of rainfall and temperature on the distribution and certain behavioral characteristics of Larrea tridentata (Creosote-bush) at and near its northern limits in the northern Mojave desert of southern Nevada, were investigated at 39 sites with Larrea and 20 sites without Larrea in eight drainage basins at elevations of 915-1,770 m over a 2,600-km' area of the Nevada Test Site. Data used were (1) rainfall records for 9 yr (1963-71) for each site; (2) maximum and minimum air temperature records for each site, November 1962- February 1972; (3) percentage cover by all shrub species and by Larrea; (4) height and density data for Larrea; and (5) percentage of germinable seeds from 29 of the Larrea populations for three seasons (1963-65) in relation to the seasonal rainfall for each site. Total percentage cover by all shrub species is highly correlated with mean annual rainfall, less well correlated with elevation. Percentage cover by Larrea follows two patterns of relation- ship with rainfall: (1) where mean rainfall is low to intermediate, the same pattern as total shrub cover in relation to rainfall, and (2) on sites of high mean rainfall, consistently low cover, a function of low density of Larrea on these sites. In general, in undisturbed com- munities, the taller the Larrea plants the fewer there are of them, but the relationship is not strictly linear. Using height as an index to plant volume, numbers of Larrea plants are highly correlated with total plant volume. Mean height is not strongly correlated with mean annual rainfall or temperature parameters, but is well correlated with the ratio of mean precipitation/ mean temperature. Tall plants ({\textgreater}1 m) occur in low density and on sites with high rainfall (mean 160-183 mm). The prevailing low minimum air temperatures and their extremes in the lowlands of enclosed drainage basins are inferred to be the primary cause of the absence of Larrea in three discrete vegetation zones (Atriplex confertifolia, Lycium pallidurn, and L. shockleyi) in Frenchman Flat, and over most of the basin floor of Yucca Flat, where the communities are Atriplex and Grayia-Lyciurn andersonii. The year-round low minima in the lowlands of these basins result from nocturnal cold air drainage phenomena and formation of a cold air layer of variable depth. Average extreme minima on these sites were mostly below 0" F; the extreme minimum was -18" F in one of the Atriplex communities of Frenchman Flat. Larrea occurs over the bajadas of Frenchman Flat on sites above the lower layers of cold air. In Yucca Flat, at its northern limits, it is restricted to certain upper bajada sites and notably one site on the basin floor. Average extreme minimum air temperatures on all Larrea sites were above lo F; the absolute minimum was -8" F. Upper altitudinal limits of Larrea apparently are not determined by minimum temperatures since minima (including the extremes) in Cole- ogyne vegetation, which replaces Larrea altitudinally on the slopes, are well within the range of those recorded on Larrea sites. There is no pattern of relationship between maximum temperatures and the distribution of Larrea, although the highest extreme maxima usually occur on non-Larrea sites in the low- lands of Frenchman Flat.},

abstract = {In this paper, we tested whether the spatial distribution of a given species in more or less fragmented and disturbed landscapes depends on the species habitat specialization. We studied 891 spatial replicates from the French Breeding Bird Survey (FBBS) monitored at least two years during 2001-2005, and two independent landscape databases measuring respectively landscape fragmentation and recent landscape disturbance on each FBBS replicate. We used a continuous habitat specialization index for the 105 most common bird species monitored by the FBBS. We further modelled the spatial variation in abundance of each species according to fragmentation and disturbance across FBBS replicates, accounting for habitat differences and spatial trends. We then tested whether more or less specialized species responded to landscape fragmentation and disturbance. We found that the more specialist a species, the more negative its spatial response to landscape fragmentation and disturbance. Although there was a very high variation around these tendencies indicating that there are many other drivers of species distribution, our results suggest that measuring specialization may be helpful in predicting which species are likely to thrive in human degraded landscapes. We also emphasize the need to consider both positive and negative species responses when assessing consequences of habitat change in communities.},
